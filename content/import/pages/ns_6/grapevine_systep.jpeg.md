## Summary


The interface of Grapevine, illustrated in Figure 1, is user-centric
and intuitive. It features a search box, a list of suggested keywords,
sliders for adjusting research interests, and a display of potential
advisors. This design enables students to actively engage in refining
their research preferences, helping them to clarify and articulate their
interests more effectively.
