Adaptive Electronic Textbooks were a topic of interests of
[Home](/ns_0/our_lab) members for
many years. While the majority of works on electronic books is concerned
with just coping the old format in the new media, we believe that moving
textbooks to electronic form brings a number of interesting
opportunities that go well beyond the functionality of traditional
printed textbooks. In our work we primarily explored the opportunities
to make an electronic book adaptive (i.e., personalized), interactive,
and social. This paper presents different ideas in the area of adaptive
electronic textbooks explored by
[Home](/ns_0/PAWS_Lab)
members.

#### Concept-based Textbooks with Adaptive Navigation Support

This work focused on constructing the
first adaptive textbooks. The personalization was based on advanced
manual indexing of textbooks with concepts and relatively simple student
modeling and personalization approaches.

#### Automating the Construction of Adaptive Textbook

This work focused on automating
several critical processes of adaptive book development that were done
manually in the first generation research. This direction engages
ontologies, advanced text processing and modeling, and machine
learning.

#### Social Navigation for Online Textbooks

This work focused
on social navigation as an alternative socially-driven mechanism to
guide readers of online textbooks to the right content. Bringing analogy
with recommender systems, the traditional knowledge-based approach was
more like content-based filtering, while social navigation is more like
collaborative filtering.

== Advanced
Student Modeling and Knowlege-Driven Recommendation for Adaptive
Textbooks ==

This work direction focuses on more advanced approaches
to model student knowledge in adaptive textbooks by monitoring all kinds
of activities, including reading and question-answering. In turn, a more
complete model of knowledge enables powerful recommendation approaches
that consider user history, knowledge, and the current reading
context
