We have developed four major types of authoring tools for the
project: 1) Content Authoring Tools for creating different kinds of
smart learning content, 2) Course Authoring Tool for creating adaptive
courses that use the content, 3) Group Authoring Tool for managing users
and groups, as well as 4) the portal to access different authoring
tools.

\| Course authoring tool provides the interface for teachers to create
courses for Mastery Grids. It is an intuitive, highly integrated
application for teaching material aggregation and editing. It allows the
user to form the structure of a course, browse and select the activities
from the resource pool and fill in the structure with appropriate
examples and quizzes. The architecture supporting course authoring tool
has a good support on multiple resource repositories, which is extremely
convenient for future extending.
