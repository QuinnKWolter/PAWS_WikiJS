Personalized Adaptive Web Systems Lab was established in 2004 with
support from National Science Foundation and the School of Information
Sciences at the University of Pittsburgh. The goal of the PAWS Lab is
development and evaluation of innovative user- and group-adaptive
Web-based technologies, systems, and architectures. The Lab currently
explores a range of user modeling, adaptation and personalization
technologies. The work of the Lab is supported by NSF and NIH
funding.
