## About Open Learning Modeling



#### Open Learner Modeling in ELM-ART

[ELM-ART](/ns_0/ELM-ART), a
combination of a Web-based Electronic Textbook and Intelligent Tutoring
System for LISP, was the first Web-Based System to implement open
editable learner model. ELM-ART offered a dynamic view, which visualized
the current state of learner knowledge about concepts and functions of
LISP programming language and allowed learners to correct system's
estimation of their
knowledge.

#### Open Learner Modeling with Adaptive Navigation Support in QuizGuide and JavaGuide

In our work with
[QuizGuide](/ns_0/quizguide) and
[JavaGuide](/ns_0/javaguide)
systems we attempted to merge the power of open learner models with the
power of adaptive navigation support. While traditional OLM focuses on
reflecting student knowledge, we wanted to give students an immediate
chance to act. For example, observing that knowledge of a specific topic
is too low, a student might want to immediately access learning content
that could help to bridge the
gap.

[QuizGuide](/ns_0/quizguide)
is an adaptive front-end to a collection of interactive self-assessment
questions in the domain of C programming. The system is able to model
learner knowledge independently by topic and visualize the state of this
learner model through adaptive link annotation of the “target-arrow”
icons. The number of arrows in the target reflects the level of
knowledge the student has acquired on the topic: the more arrows the
target has, the higher the level of knowledge. The intensity of the
target’s color shows the relevance of the topic to the current learning
goal: the more intense the color is, the more relevant the topic. This
interface combined successful features of open learner models and
navigation support: it provides a clear presentation of student
knowledge by topic while also helping the student to select the optimal
topic to work (one that is ready to be explored, but still not
mastered). Check

section to learn more about the systems and the value of this integrated
approach.
