Various e-learning systems that provide electronic textbooks are
gathering data on large numbers of student reading interactions. This
data can potentially be used to model student knowledge acquisition.
However, reading activity is often overlooked in canonical student
modeling. Prior studies modeling learning from reading either estimate
student knowledge at the end of all reading activities, or use quiz
performance data with expert-crafted knowledge components (KCs). In this
work, we demonstrate that the dynamic modeling of student knowledge is
feasible and that automatic text analysis can be applied to save expert
effort. We propose a data-driven approach for dynamic student modeling
in textbook-based learning. We formulate the problem of modeling
learning from reading as a reading- time prediction problem, reconstruct
existing popular student models (such as Knowledge Tracing) and explore
two automatic text analysis approaches (bag-of-words-based and latent
semantic-based) to build the KC model. We evaluate the proposed
framework using a dataset collected from a Human-Computer Interaction
course. Results show that our approach for reading modeling is
plausible; the pro- posed Knowledge Tracing-based student model reliably
outperforms baselines and the latent semantic-based approach can be a
promising way to construct a KC model.

Overall, our work could be
considered as the first step to model dynamic knowledge in
textbook-based learning. We believe that our framework is promising and
that its application lies beyond textbook-based learning. This framework
can be applied to a broader context of open-corpus personal- ized
learning, empowering learners with the ability to access the right
reading content at the right moment, despite the huge volume of online
educational content.
