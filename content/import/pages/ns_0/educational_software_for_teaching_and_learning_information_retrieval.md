## Project Summary


This project addresses two related instructional problems: the
difficulty which students encounter in trying to understand the basic
underlying retrieval models; and the need for access to a body of
existing resources or tools with which students can build systems and
system components in order to implement these models. The goals of this
project are to build upon, organize and distribute interactive software
tools to improve instruction in the field of information
retrieval:

* To develop simulation and visualization tools which
will aid students in information retrieval courses in the School of
Information Sciences to understand the models underlying information
retrieval systems;
* To evaluate rigorously the usefulness of the
developed tools in the context of teaching information retrieval;
* To
identify, organize and assess other interactive tools for instruction in
information retrieval in order to provide an index of available
tools;
* To expand awareness in different departments and libraries of
the University of Pittsburgh as well as in other universities and
libraries of the resources developed and/or identified by the
project.

#### Funding

The project is funded by University of
Pittsburgh [\| Advisory Council on Instructional
Excellence](http://www.pitt.edu/~facaffs/acie/) in 2003.
