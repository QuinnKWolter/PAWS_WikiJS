In this system, a special type of the user model is supported called as
a task model. It is aimed at supporting information analysts who are
required to solve a specific task. A very short term user model is
constructed to model each different user task and personalization is
made with the task models. A post filtering approach was applied to this
purpose. The ad-hoc retrieval results triggered by user queries were
re-ordered using the task model so that more relevant documents to the
task model should be ranked up in the lists. In terms of the interface,
we added a control with which users can control the effects of the query
and the task model according to their needs and the
context.
