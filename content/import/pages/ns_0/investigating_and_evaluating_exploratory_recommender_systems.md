## Overview


This project is focused on a popular category of interactive
Recommender Systems (RecSys) known as user-controlled RecSys. The idea
of user-controlled RecSys is to engage the user in controlling some
aspects of the recommendation process such as choosing peers for
collaborative filtering, fusing several recommender algorithms, or
deducing user current preferences. While the traditional data-driven
approaches estimate these parameters from data trying to optimize the
results across many users and contexts, in many cases user data is not
sufficient to make a reliable “guess”. As demonstrated by many existing
examples, leaving control over some aspects of the recommendation
process to the user avoids guessing and leads to a better user
experience in each specific case. A good example of simple user control
is the carousel-based interface in some industrial recommenders. This
approach leaves it to the user to choose which category of items they
are currently interested in instead of the traditional attempt to
“guess” it with too little information and offer users a single ranked
list.

The target of this proposal is algorithms for user-controlled
recommendation. While recent work on user-controlled RecSys demonstrated
the value of this approach, this stream of research predominantly used
simple recommer algorithms. In other words, the focus was on the user at
the expense of the AI. In this project, we want to restore the balance
by developing a better generation of recommender algorithms that can
benefit from user control.
