We are looking for collaborators who are interested in using PCLab in
introductory Java/Python programming classes. PCLab is designed to help
students to construct programs. It consists of programming examples and
coding exercises for different topics in the introductory programming
course.

#### Mastery Grids Interface

PCLab presents examples and problems using Mastery Grids interface.
Mastery Grids is both an innovative Open Social Learner Model Interface
and an adaptive E-learning platform with integrated functionalities
enabling multi-facet social comparison, open learner modeling, and
adaptive navigation support to access multiple kinds of smart learning
content. Mastery Grids is supported by adaptive social learning
framework
[Aggregate](/ns_0/aggregate).
This framework supports several kinds of open student modeling, social
comparison, and recommendation. In detail, Mastery Grids presents and
compares user learning progress and knowledge level using colored grids,
tracks user activities with learning content, and provides flexible
user-centered navigation across different content levels (e.g. topic,
question) and different content types (e.g. problem, example). Our past
research shows that open student modeling and social comparison
effectively increases students’ performance, motivation, engagement, and
retention.
