Dr. Jingtao is a Professor at the CS department at the
University of Pittsburgh. In this talk, he presents part of his research
interest but in particular he talks about EventMaps, a system to help
people manage conferences. Eventmaps has a purpose similar to our
Conference Navigator, so we discussed about the possibility to work in
conjunction with Dr. Wang.

Michael and Sharon enrich Knowledge Tree with recommendation
and bookmarking. According to a user's behavior of bookmarking, the
system could recommend diverse examples to the user. The bookmarking
service functions independently and could be re-used across several
system. A lot of recommendation algorithms could be tried on it.
Besides, expanding collections of annotated examples is also what they
can improve in the future.

Jennifer rehearsed the paper which she is going to present in ASIS&T
conference. Group members gave her some suggestions.

Sherry presented "Resource Recommendation for Social Tagging: A
Multi-Channel Hybrid Approach" from RecSys'10 workshop. Although the
hybrid solution suggested by the authors didn't really preform well in
their three scenarios, we still could learn from them about their design
methods and concerns. Multiple information channels are definitely
worthy to exploit. While we are trying to engage some social resources
into our systems, the nature of the resources, the nature of the users ,
the type of task that the system is intended to support and so on are
required to be identified before implementating.
