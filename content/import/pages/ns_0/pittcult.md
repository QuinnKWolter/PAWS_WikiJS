[PITTCULT](http://pittcult.sis.pitt.edu) is to share and recommend
cultural event information in the Pittsburgh area. This system basically
utilizes human psychology to conform to opinions of friends. When people
go to a music concert or exhibition, they commonly ask their friends'
opinions, and invite them to go along. Centered on this trusted human
network, users can recommend items to their friends and rate their
friends' taste about a certain genre of cultural events. This system is
to cope with various problems of traditional collaborative filtering
technique such as ad-hoc user problem (users copying other users'
profile), data sparsity, blackship users and system scalability.
