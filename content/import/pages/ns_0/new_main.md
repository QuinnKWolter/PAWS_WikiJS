====) 2010-09-17 :: Mike's Thesis Defence:
PROVIDING SERVICE-BASED PERSONALIZATION IN AN ADAPTIVE HYPERMEDIA SYSTEM
====

Mike's dissertation proposed a novel way of speeding the
development of new adaptive
hypermedia systems. The gist of the
approach is to extract the adaptation functionality out of the
adaptive
hypermedia system, encapsulate it into a standalone system, and offer
adaptation as a
service to the client applications. Such standalone
adaptation provider reduces the development
of adaptation functionality
to configuration and compliance and as a result creates new
adaptive
systems faster and helps serve larger user populations with
adaptively accessible content. <a

###### 2010-09-08 :: Jae-Wook's Thesis Defence: Adaptive Visualization for Focused Personalized Information Retrieval

Jae-wook Ahn's dissertation proposes to incorporate interactive
visualization into personalized search in order to overcome the
limitation. By combining the personalized search and the interactive
visualization, we expect our approach will be able to help users to
better explore the information space and locate relevant information
more efficiently. <a
