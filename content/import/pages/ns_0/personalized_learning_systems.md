Personalized Learning Systems is one of the core topics of our lab.
Personalized learning technologies provide an alternative to the
dominant “one-size-fits-all” approach to treating diverse student
audiences. While having a relatively long history, this research
direction moved to the forefront only recently when modern information
technologies opened new learning opportunities for a wide range of
students. Nowadays, personalized learning is considered to be a top
priority research direction by many experts. For example, [advanced
personalized
learning](http://www.engineeringchallenges.org/cms/8996/9127.aspx) was
named among [14 Grand Challenges for
Engineering](http://www.engineeringchallenges.org/) along with
preventing nuclear terror and making solar energy economical. It has
also been listed among the highest funding priorities in [Communications
of the
ACM](http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2010/2/69358-assessing-the-changing-us-it-rd-ecosystem/fulltext).

Personalized
learning technologies enable e-learning systems to maintain a model of
the goals, preferences and knowledge of each student and apply this
model to adapt the system performance to the student making the learning
process more efficient and enjoyable. In so doing, various kinds of
personalized e-learning systems demonstrated their ability to help
students acquire knowledge faster, improve learning outcomes, reduce
navigational overhead, and increase student engagement. Our team is
interested a range of personalized learning technologies, focusing on
modeling learner knowledge of the subject. Individual models of learner
knowledge that our systems maintain are used to guide learners to the
most appropriate learning content using course sequencing and adaptive
navigation support technologies. Some systems also use the models to
deliver adaptive visualization. Below is the list of personalized
learning systems developed by the members of our group. Most of these
systems are open for anyone to use and explore online.
