YourNews is a news
recommendation system based on the RSS feeds collected from various news
sources. News articles are crawled every two hours, indexed, and then
provided to users according to their specific needs.

The
personalization for different user interests are made by keeping track
of the news articles they had read and storing the information to user
models. For different scopes and topics, multiple user models are
constructed and maintained, so that users can switch to different user
models according to their needs.

One of the core technologies of
YourNews is the open user model, where the user models are also visible
to users so that they can see what's going on under the hood and even
control the contents of them.
