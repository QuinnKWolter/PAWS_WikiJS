## About the project


The project explored the use of personalization and mobile computing
to increase user engagement in location-bound social systems. The
project was originally funded by a Research Award from Google to Peter
Brusilovsky, however it continued for many years following the original
round of funding. In the course of the project we developed, extended,
and explored several location-bounded systems such as Comet, Eventur,
and CourseAgent. These systems were actively used for many years in
local Pittsburgh community. We developed a range of new recommendation
technologies for these systems and explored new approaches to increase
user engagement, which is the source of knowledge in local
communities

#### Motivation

Social computing systems can serve as a
tool for revitalizing and strengthening local communities - in
particular by supporting online community information commons for
enriching and actively disseminating information about local events,
activities, and organizations. While existing social linking systems can
allow people to follow or meet each other, they tend to do so in
decontextualized virtual spaces and as a result are seen by many as a
threat to local communities. In contrast, a social information system
that provides a community information commons for collecting, organizing
and exploring information about local events and organizations, has the
potential to increase individuals’ awareness and connection with their
community. However, creating an effective community information commons
is challenging.

First, information about local events, activities
and organizations is often fragmented, incomplete, and difficult to
find. While existing channels work well for organizations able to devote
resources to formal marketing and advertising, a sustainable community
information commons must allow a more diverse set of community members
to participate in collection and organization information in a
decentralized fashion. Social computing technologies and techniques have
the potential to provide a platform through which the small efforts of
individuals, both within a community and beyond, can be mobilized to
increase the quality of information available about local events,
activities, and organizations. However, in spite of their potential,
engaging users in social computing systems can be challenging. Users are
eager to contribute for their own good (i.e., list an item to sell on
Craigslist), but very hesitant to do it for a community good. Local
community information systems must pursue different engagement
strategies if they are to provide a useful, organized source of
information about local events and activities.

At the same time, any
system that is even moderately successful at aggregating information
about community events has to be personalized. No one is interested all
events and organizations. Even in a small community, the ability to
focus in items of interest within a larger information stream is
necessary. A viable community information commons must support
personalized information access, enabling individuals to increase the
likelihood of seeing personally interesting materials and decrease the
distraction of irrelevant events. \t

The goal of this project is to
investigate the nature of community information commons and develop
social computing technologies and techniques to increase the impact and
viability of these critical socio-technical systems.
