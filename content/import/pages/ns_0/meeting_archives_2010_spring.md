**INTELLIGENT TUTORING INFRASTRUCTURE FOR
PROFILING DETERMINISTIC WEB-BASED SCHOLARS**

**Summary**

Web-based
learning is an important paradigm for supporting flexible, constructive
and innovative teaching and learning in a matured learning environment.
It is important to demonstrate the prospective impacts of this
technology in formal teaching as well as self-paced learning and
assessments. As such, there is need for systems that can address
concerns in web-based learning in such a manner as to imitate real life
situations so as to deliver the values needed in the educational sector.
This presentation is aimed at promoting a system that can encourage
learners and teachers to work collaboratively towards the education
reform by empowering teachers’ e-pedagogy competence and facilitating
collaborative education at all levels. Architecture for Such Intelligent
web based pedagogical system is subsequently discussed.

**Research
problem**

# In what way can we can put together the pedagogical

activities that can enhance teaching and learning beyond the barriers
traditional classroom structure?

# What are the best models that can

facilitate the school system into becoming a virtual community?

# How

can we convert the pedagogical and administrative demands of educational
system into technology-driven infrastructure

# How can the association

between the teachers and learners be classified in such a manner as to
translate into a collaborative society?
