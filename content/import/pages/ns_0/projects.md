Interactive Electronic Textbook for Python Programming and Data Science
Courses</a> ===

Peter Brusilovsky proposes to develop AdaPT, an
interactive and adaptive system for learning and practicing Python
programming and Data Science skills, which fuses a well-tested
electronic textbook with a large volume of “smart” interactive learning
content: worked code examples, code animations, and several types of
automatically assessed practice problems. The system uses advanced
learner modeling to trace the growth of learner’s knowledge and skills
and to identify misunderstood concepts. Adapting dynamically to the
current state of knowledge, it suggests most appropriate interactive
content to practice at every step of learning.

and Evaluating Exploratory Recommender Systems</a>===
Exploratory
recommender systems bring together the power of Human and Artificial
Intelligence through human-AI collaboration and user-controlled
recommendation. In this project, we develop and evaluate exploratory
recommender systems in several domains. The focus of the project are
carousel-based interfaces and novel recommender algorithms that can
better adapt to user actions in the human-AI collaboration
process.

Science Education</a>===
Researchers from the University of Pittsburgh,
Carnegie Mellon University, North Carolina State University, and
Virginia Tech collaborate to support the Computer Science Education Hub,
social and technical infrastructure to accelerate research on teaching
and learning of computing disciplines. The Hub will host community
events and provide a web repository for computing education datasets,
tools, and common analysis methods. The Hub facilitates creation and
adoption of new tools to support computing educators and students, and
new standards to support data collection and data-enabled research. Hub
community events help researchers and educators from many learning
contexts to develop and improve computing education
resources.

Complementary Learning Principles in Aphasia Rehabilitation via Adaptive
Modeling</a>===

Aphasia, commonly caused by stroke or other acquired
brain injuries, can have a negative effect on an individual’s quality of
life, often leading to depression and feelings of isolation. A primary
frustration for people with aphasia is anomia, or word-finding
difficulty. In this NIH-funded project, an interdisciplinary team of
researchers will work on developing and evaluating novel adaptive
computer-based aphasia treatments to help improve the efficiency and
long-term impact of language treatment.

- Health e-Librarian with Personalized Recommender</a>===
As the
Internet has become a prominent source of health information to guide
patients’ decision-making and self-management activities, patients
strongly indicate they need navigational support to locate appropriate
information on the Internet. The overall goal of this project is to
build and implement a “Health E-Librarian with Personalized
Recommendations (HELPeR)” - a personalized information access system
with a hybrid recommender engine that adapts to different aspects of the
patient: information needs based on the user’s profile, the user’s
uniquely expressed information interests, and the level of user’s
disease-related knowledge.

and Infrastructure Design for Data-Intensive Research in Computer
Science Education</a>===
The mission of this collaborative project is
to support the CS Education community by supplying documentation and
infrastructure to help with adopting shared standards, protocols, and
tools. In this way we hope to promote
* development and broader re-use
of innovative learning content that is instrumented for rich data
collection;
* formats and tools for analysis of learner data; and
*
best practices to make large collections of learner data and associated
analytics available to researchers in the CSE, data science, and learner
science communities.

This
project is a joint effort of research teams at the University of Memphis
and the University of Pittsburgh to explore the process of code
comprehension by students and build AI-based tools to support the
practice and assessment of code comprehension. In the course of the
project, we developed and evaluated open-learned modeling approaches,
code-tracing tools to practice code comprehension, and an intelligent
tutor for assessing code comprehension through
explanations.

Learning</a>===
This project challenges the assumption that adaptive
hypermedia systems require expensive knowledge engineering for domain
and content modeling. It replaces the carefully-crafted domain model
with automatically-created domain models, lowering the cost of
developing such systems while also providing a wider range of
instructional paths through the content.
