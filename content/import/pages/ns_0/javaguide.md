## Overview


JavaGuide is a personalized front-end for
[QuizJET](/ns_0/quizjet) developed
by PAWS Lab (Hsiao, 2010). Java Guide collects student performance data
sent by QuizJET to the activity storage, determines student current
level of knowledge for multiple topics and concepts of Java programming
language, and use it to provide adaptive guidance to the questions that
are most appropriate for a specific student given the course goals and
current state of knowledge. The navigation support is provided on the
level of topics using “Target/Arrows” visual cues where the color of
target icon associated with each topic indicates the current importance
of the topic and the number of arrows in the target shows the current
student knowledge level of the correspondent topics. Several classroom
studies of QuizJET demonstrated that the user of personalized front-end
significantly increases student performance and nearly doubles course
engagement.
