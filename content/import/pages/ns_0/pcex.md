Program Construction Examples (PCEX) is an interactive learning tool
which demonstrates program construction examples to help students to
develop program construction skills. It supports exploring the program
construction examples freely and provide challenges to the students to
help them self-assess their learning of program construction knowledge.
Each *example* provides a goal that specify the given example’s
functionality. Each *challenge* is designed closely to the examples
provided with faded lines. Students need to drag-drop provided sample
lines to complete a program to accomplish the provided program goal.


#### PCEX Interface

===Example===
The first screenshot is from an
example in PCEX about celsius to fahrenheit conversion with interactive
explanation of the selected line (highlighted in yellow)

===Challenge===
The second screenshot is from
an challenge in PCEX which is the ‘challenge’ of the previously shown
example. Here the goal of the program is to complete the program which
converts fahrenheit to celsius. In the current screenshot, the student
made a mistake in one of the missing lines and got immediate feedback
stating that the output of the current program is different from the
expected one. Student may see the details of the error or request for a
hint which basically describes the explanation of that missing line.
