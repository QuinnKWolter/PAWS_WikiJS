Adaptive VIBE is a variation of VIBE, a reference point-based spatial
visualization algorithm. It supports the visualization of user models as
well as usual documents. User model is displayed as a separate group of
POIs (Points of Interests or reference points). Because it is located in
distant positions from the query POIs, users can mediate visually
between their explicit interests (queries) and the system estimated
interests or search contents (user models).
