## Overview



Progressor+ attempts to inherit the merits from
[Progressor](http://adapt2.sis.pitt.edu/wiki/Progressor) (motivational
impacts, personalized social guidance and encourages students to do some
work ahead of the course schedule, class leaders provided an implicit
social guidance for the rest of the class and successfully led the way
to discover the most relevant resources creating good trails for the
rest of the class, etc. please refer to our
[publications](http://adapt2.sis.pitt.edu/wiki/Publications#Progressor))
and incorporate with new research elements, such as flexible content
structure, explicit social guidance and so on. Despite Progressor's
circular pie shapes are favorable in our past user studies, the nature
of those shapes makes it difficult to scale up with various learning
content collections and perform comparisons, we refine our design into a
more generic table representation and engage with close-to-reality
multiple collections of learning resources.
