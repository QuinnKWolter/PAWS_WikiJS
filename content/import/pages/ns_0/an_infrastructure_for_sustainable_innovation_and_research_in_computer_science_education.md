## Overview


Researchers from the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon
University, North Carolina State University, and Virginia Tech
collaborate to support the Computer Science Education Hub, social and
technical infrastructure to accelerate research on teaching and learning
of computing disciplines. The Hub will host community events and provide
a web repository for computing education datasets, tools, and common
analysis methods. The Hub facilitates the creation and adoption of new
tools to support computing educators and students, and new standards to
support data collection and data-enabled research. Hub community events
help researchers and educators from many learning contexts to develop
and improve computing education resources.

The Hub provides a
pioneering example of infrastructure to support data-enabled research on
education in Computing and beyond. It advances Computing Education
Research through: (1) building a community and website that helps
instructors adopt evidence-based practices and innovative learning
technologies, (2) creating data standards and large, high-quality
datasets, (3) developing advanced algorithms using artificial
intelligence, statistics, and analytics methods that leverage data to
optimize student learning effectiveness, efficiency, and engagement, (4)
developing rigorous evaluation methods to demonstrate large, lasting,
and replicable impacts on student achievement. Cross-disciplinary
scientific advances are disseminated through the Hub infrastructure
community and scientific publications.

This project follows our
earlier infrastructure community-development project "<a

class="wikilink"
title="Community-Building and Infrastructure Design for Data-Intensive Research in Computer Science Education">Community-Building
and Infrastructure Design for Data-Intensive Research in Computer
Science Education</a>". It is supported by NSF award [CNS 2213789
(2017-2021)](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2213789&HistoricalAwards=false).

#### Project Web Site

To distribute project-related information, we
maintain the project website
[<http://cssplice.org/>](http://cssplice.org/), where all project
information including standards, best practices, and resources are be
shared. It informs the community about events and opportunities to
contribute. The site provides links to project publications, code, data,
and learning content hosted in archival repositories such as GitHub and
DataShop.

#### Call for Collaborators: What we can offer

===
Reusable Smart Learning Content===
We have many types of “smart
learning content” (various interactive problems and examples) for Java,
Python, SQL. Content could be re-used in other classes individually, or
as a package through personalized Mastery Grids interface.
* Read
more about it in the
<a href="Smart_Content" class="wikilink" title="Smart Content">Smart
Content</a> section of the Wiki
* See demos of our “old” content for

[SQL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbiq7T7rx-k)

===Adaptive
practice system===
We have an infrastructure that allows building
flexible practice systems (which students could use on their own) for
Java, Python, SQL. The system allows to create support for any course in
the field - you define a sequence of topics, assign content to topics,
and receive a fully-ready system with an adaptive interface. The system
supports our own smart content and several types of interoperable
content created by our collaborators. In total, there are 7 types of
content for Python, 6 types for Java and 6 types for SQL.
We can help
you to create a custom support exactly for your course. The system could
be used to run extensive classroom studies and collect data. Read more

Call for Collaborators: What we are looking for==
===More Smart
Learning Content!===
We are interested in collaborating with other
developers of smart learning content to make it more interoperable and
to feature in our personalized systems for Python, Java, and SQL.

===More Studies with Data Collection===
Our ultimate goal is to learn
more about how people learn programming and better support them with
adaptive educational systems. To get there we need to run more studies
of different type of smart learning content and different
personalization approaches. We want to partner with instructors in Java,
Python and Database classes who are interested to engage their student
in practicing computer science concepts with different types of smart
learning content. See what we have in “When we can offer” section above
and get in touch! It is a great chance to make interesting discoveries
and publish good papers.
In particular, we just developed PCLab system
with several new types of learning content to support learning program
construction skills - for which we have the least data. We are
especially interested to run studies of this new content.
See PCLab
demos for Python (http://bit.ly/pclab-python) and Java
(http://bit.ly/pclab-java)
