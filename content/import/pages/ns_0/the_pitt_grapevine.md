## About the project


The goal of the project is to connect students with research advisors
at the University of Pittsburgh through an interactive recommender
system.

The project was originally funded by the University of
Pittsburgh through the [Personalized
Education](https://www.provost.pitt.edu/priorities/personalizing-education)
program (2018-2020), however, it is still going on, several years after
the end of the two original rounds of funding. In the course of the
project, we developed and evaluated several versions of the interactive
recommender system Grapevine.
