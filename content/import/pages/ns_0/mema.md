The system is built upon a collection with approximately 80,000

photographs by Charles "Teenie" Harris, a photographer for an

influential local newspaper, the Pittsburgh Courier. This
collection
illustrates a 40-year period of Pittsburgh history
through the eyes of
an African-American photo-journalist and
amateur historian. MEMA
stands for Museum Exhibition
MAnagement. It is a system with mobile
and Web features. To
be completely compatible for all mobile devices,
we designed a
mobile website with flexible views for various mobile
phone
screens. Users with handheld devices could post their ideas and

feelings at any time in the exhibition, with a Wi-Fi connection

provided by the museum. This mobile site is custom built for the

exhibition “Teenie Harris, Photographer: An American Story” at
the
Carnegie Museum of Art. It provides a friendly and intuitive

navigation structure to assist users to visit the exhibition (see

Figure 1). Visitors can navigate the mobile system by four

categories including “HOT!”,”Theme”, “Date”, and “Ex. No”.
The
“HOT!” category could lead visitors to the most popular
items that are
getting the most feedback in the gallery. In
addition, visitors can
search for a specific item by entering the
exhibition number displayed
under each of the photographs on
view. Four types of interactive
feedback are provided: “like”,
“comment”, “tag”, and feedbacks on
Twitter and Facebook. This
functionality is available for every item
displayed in the gallery.
