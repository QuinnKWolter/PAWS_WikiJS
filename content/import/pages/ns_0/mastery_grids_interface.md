Mastery Grids is an
<a href="open_social_learner_modeling" class="wikilink"
title="open social learner modeling">open social learner modeling</a>
interface written in Javascript. The interface shows the student's
progress or knowledge in topics or content types comparing with other
learners, and provides navigation support to access suitable educational
content.

#### Open Social Learner Model

Mastery Grids is a
personalized educational system built to support practice with multiple
types of smart learning content. Mastery Grids interface offers
topic-based open learner modeling, which integrates features explored on
our past successful systems (e.g.,
[InterBook](/ns_0/InterBook),
[QuizGuide](/ns_0/quizguide),
[NavEx](/ns_0/navex),
[QuizMap](/ns_0/QuizMap),
[Progressor](/ns_0/progressor)).
Combining open learner model with social comparison, i.e., open social
learner model, Mastery Grids makes students aware of the strength and
weakness of their own knowledge on the system topics and allows them to
compare their knowledge with the knowledge of their peers. Our open
social learner model encourages students to catch up with other students
(observing average class progress or advanced students’ progress) and
follow the potential good learning path of their peers.

#### Knowledge and Progress Visualization

Mastery Grids presents and compares user
learning progress and knowledge level (mastery) by colored grids from
four perspectives as shown in the following figure. The four
perspectives show the current student’s progress (“Me” or my progress),
a comparison of performance of current student versus other student in
the group (“Me vs group” or comparison grid), performance of the
students in the group (“Group” or group grid), and performance of all of
the students in the class.

#### Social Comparison

Social comparison is implemented in two ways: 1)
Me vs group, which compares an individual learner’s progress or
knowledge level with the entire group of students, and 2) Me vs other
students, which compares an an individual learner’s progress or
knowledge level with each of other students. Such comparisons can be
further conducted by resource types (learning materials) as shown in
following figure.

#### Adaptive Navigation Support

Mastery Grids also provides adaptive
navigation support for learning materials (as shown in following figure
with stars indicating the recommendations). It tracks user activities
and updates student knowledge level in a centralized user modeling
server, and thus can report in both progress level (based on activities)
and knowledge level (based on estimated user knowledge). It provides
flexible user-centered navigation across different content levels (e.g.
topic, each content type) and different content types (e.g. problem,
animated example) and tracks user feedbacks on recommendations
dynamically. Details of user modeling can be found
[here](http://adapt2.sis.pitt.edu/wiki/Adaptive_Navigation_Support_and_Open_Social_Learner_Modeling_for_PAL#Learner_Model).
Details of the personalization (recommendation) can be found
