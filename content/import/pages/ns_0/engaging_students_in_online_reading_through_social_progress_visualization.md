Almost
every college course expects students to complete weekly readings from
course textbooks or other kinds of course materials. Knowledge to be
acquired during weekly reading assignment is critical for students’
course success. Yet, it is not easy for an instructor to assure that the
student completed the assigned readings. Reading assignments produce no
artifacts to grade. As a result, the students frequently have
insufficient motivation to complete the reading assignments. This
project explores an alternative approach to encourage student reading
using a social progress visualization interface
<a href="ReadingCircle" class="wikilink"
title="ReadingCircle">ReadingCircle</a>.
* student online reading
process is tracked on the level of individual sections
* student
reading progress is visualized on several levels – from chapters to
sections to subsections – and presented to the student
* students are
offered an interface to compare their reading progress with both, the
progress of the class as a whole and the progress of individual
peers

#### Funding

The project is funded by University of
Pittsburgh [Council on Instructional
Excellence](http://www.pitt.edu/~facaffs/acie/%7CAdvisory) in
2012.
