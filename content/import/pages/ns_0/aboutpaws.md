## PAWS Lab



Personalized Adaptive Web Systems Lab was established in 2004 with
support from National Science Foundation and School of Information
Sciences. The goal of the PAWS Lab is development and evaluation of
innovative user- and group-adaptive Web-based technologies, systems, and
architectures. The Lab currently explores a range of user modeling,
adaptation and personalization technologies. The work of the Lab is
supported by NSF and DARPA funding.
