## Project Summary


It has often been claimed that humans use solutions to previous
problems to solve new problems or planning tasks. Especially in the
domain of programming, both experienced and novice programmers often use
program examples to learn the semantics and pragmatics of programming
languages and to solve programming problems. To support this need, this
projects focused on developing a rich Web-based database of programming
examples that students can explore at their own pace. In the course of
this project, we developed
[WebEx](/ns_0/webex), a Web-based
tool for exploring interactive programming examples and
[NavEx](/ns_0/navex), an adaptive
navigation support service the guides students to most appropriate
examples.

#### Funding

The project is funded by University of
Pittsburgh [\| Advisory Council on Instructional
Excellence](http://www.pitt.edu/~facaffs/acie/) in 2001.
