[Eventur](http://eventur.sis.pitt.edu) (formerly
[PittCult](/ns_0/pittcult)) is an
adaptive social system for sharing and recommending cultural event
information in the Pittsburgh area. This system utilizes human
psychology to conform to opinions of friends. When people go to a music
concert or exhibition, they commonly ask their friends' opinions, and
invite them to go along. Centered on this trusted human network, users
can recommend items to their friends and rate their friends' taste about
a certain genre of cultural events. This system is to cope with various
problems of traditional collaborative filtering technique such as ad-hoc
user problem (users copying other users' profile), data sparsity,
black-sheep users and system scalability.
