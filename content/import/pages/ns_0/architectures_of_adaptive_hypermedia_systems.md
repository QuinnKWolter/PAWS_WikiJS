This page is a tentative home for an anticipated workshop code-named
"Architectures of Adaptive Hypermedia Systems" (working title). Its main
purpose is to maintain awareness of the workshop organization
process.

#### Choosing The Right Name And Focus

Most recent
first
* Scalability And Infrastructure Issies Of User Adaptive And
Cognitive Systems (Michael)
** compromised abstract version, covers
all important buzz-words (SIIUACS)
* Framework/infrastructure issues
in \[distributed/component-based\] adaptive hypermedia systems
(Michael)
** Infrastructure Issues In Adaptive Hypermedia Systems -
IIIAHS - cool abbreviation :) [logo
ideas](http://adapt2.sis.pitt.edu/wiki/Image:Iiiahs_ws_logo_ideas.png)
*
Architectures and Approaches for Personalization and Adaptation
(Eelco) - not just architectures, but also approaches to
personalization
* Architectures of \[distributed\] \[component-based\]
personalized/user-adaptive systems (Peter)
* Architectures of Adaptive
Hypermedia Systems - too restrictive?

#### Topics

To include (address, be
aware, or relate to)
* CMS and AS: striking the right balance while
separating the two, ways to implement "hooks"/callbacks on CMS for
connecting to AS
* metadata for content: self-aware content (knows own
metadata) vs. agnostic content
* UM - AS: one-to-many and
many-to-one
** mapping/conversion/exchange of UMs
** cross-system
modeling
** cross-domain generalization
** standardizing UM
representation
* user interface considerations of AS
** manifested
UI (changing the UI) vs. hidden
** scopes of most effective
applicability of the two
* framework/architecture/infrastructure
implementation
** ubiquity of infrastructure (extravert approach,
third-party services) vs. utility (tradeoffs of introvert
approach)
** infrastructure "penetration" thresholds
** existence
of standards
** applicability scopes of approaches
* case studies
and lessons learned
Not to include
*
yet-another-\[pseudo-\]architecture

#### Vocabulary

* content
management system (CMS), aka Web CMS (WCMS) - users' entry point, the
portal, the content aggregator
* user model (UM), aka user modeling
server/service (UMS)
* adaptation service (AS), aka personalization
service (PService), aka adaptive functionality (AF)
* content, aka
materials, aka resources
* \[domain\] vocabulary, aka \[domain\]
ontology - \[structured\] set of concepts, describing items of
content
* \[content\] metadata - \[weighted\] list of domain concepts
describing content item
