The **Worked Example Authoring Tool (WEAT)** is an innovative tool
designed to facilitate the creation of worked examples for programming
education through a *human-AI collaboration* approach. By integrating
ChatGPT, WEAT assists instructors in generating line-by-line
explanations for code examples in Java and Python. Instructors can
provide the code and problem statement, and WEAT uses ChatGPT to
generate explanations for each line of code. These explanations can then
be reviewed, edited, and added into the worked examples, streamlining
the process of creating educational programming materials.
