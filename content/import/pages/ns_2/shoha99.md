Dr. Sharon Hsiao is
Assistant Professor & David Packard endowed junior fellow in the
Department of Computer Science & Engineering at Santa Clara University.
Dr. Hsiao was an assistant professor at Arizona State University and
Columbia University, where she established several research projects and
taught graduate & undergraduate level courses. Dr. Hsiao’s research
focuses on educational technologies, computational modeling, visual
analytics, and adaptive technology for personalized learning. Her
research methodology involves AI and HCI approaches, applied data
science and machine learning techniques in researching effective
technology to help people learn. Dr. Hsiao actively involves in several
international research communities, including Educational Data Mining
(EDM), Learning Analytics & Knowledge(LAK), Artificial Intelligence in
Education (AIED), and European Conference on Technology Enhanced
Learning (EC-TEL). She serves as the Program Chair of 14th International
Conference on Educational Data Mining and the Organizing Chair of the
9th of International Conference on Learning Analytics &
Knowledge.

Prior to SCU, Sharon has worked in EdLab in Teachers
College at Columbia University as a post-doctoral innovation fellow. She
was also affiliated with Columbia's Quantitative Methods in the Social
Sciences (QMSS) program as an adjunct Assistant Professor, where she
taught a course on Data Visualization and supervised several graduate
research projects. Sharon has also served as an Assistant Professor in
the School of Computing, Informatics & Decision Systems Engineering at
Arizona State University.

Sharon's interests in computational
technologies for learning, open social student modeling and computer
science education originate from her formative years at the iSchool at
Pitt, where she worked with Dr. Peter Brusilovsky in the Personalized
Adaptive Web Systems (PAWS) group. Under Dr. Brusilovsky’s guidance,
Hsiao had “an amazing experience” working in the PAWS lab and most
enjoyed working “collaboratively and independently” with other students
to “produce high quality publications yearly, exchange ideas, share
passions and support each other every day.”
