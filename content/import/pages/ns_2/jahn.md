is a [research staff
member](http://researcher.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-jaewook.ahn)
at the Department of Distributed AI, [IBM
Research](http://www.research.ibm.com/). He has participated in various
projects at the Department of Cognitive Science and Education and IBM
Watson Life Group such as Project Cardinal, Sesame Workshop, and [Chef
Watson](https://www.ibmchefwatson.com). He is specialized in information
visualization, human-computer interaction, personalized search, and
recommender systems. Before joining IBM, he was a member of the School
of Information Sciences PAWS (Personalized Adaptive Web Systems) Lab and
received his Ph.D. while publishing a number of papers with his advisor
Professor Peter Brusilovsky at premier conferences and journals such as
World Wide Web 2007/2008, UMAP (User Modeling, Adaptation, and
Personalization) 2010, Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI) 2015, Web
Intelligence (WI) and IP&M (Information Processing and
Management).

After graduation, he was selected as a prestigious
NSF-CRA Computing Innovation Fellow (http://cifellows.org) in 2010 and
worked with Professor Ben Shneiderman at the University of Maryland
Human-Computer Interaction Lab. The fellowship supported outstanding new
computer or information science Ph.D.'s on their post-doctoral research.
His work on network evolution visualization was published at conferences
and a journal. In particular his IEEE TVCG (Transactions on
Visualization and Computer Graphics) article was selected as the
Highlight of the Month by the journal editors and was invited to present
at ACM SIGGRAPH Asia conference in 2014. He also worked as a data
