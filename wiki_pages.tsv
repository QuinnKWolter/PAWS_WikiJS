Berlin / Heidelberg: Springer.</div>\n\n== Overview ==\n[[CUMULATE]] is a centralized user modeling server built for the [[ADAPT2|ADAPT<sup>2</sup>]] architecture. It is mainly targeted at providing user modeling support for adaptive educational hypermedia (AEH) systems. [[CUMULATE]]'s data model consists of the following.\n* users, groups of users, and group membership links (syndicated from [[Knowledge Tree]])\n* learning objects, learning object providers (client applications)\n* knowledge components - concepts - grouped in learning domains\n* learning object metadata index - links between learning objects and corresponding concepts\n* user activity log - historical log of all reported user interaction with learning objects\n* assertions about user's knowledge of concepts ([concepts'] knowledge)\n* summaries of user's interaction with learning objects, such as: number of attempts, percent complete, etc. ([learning objects'] progress)\n[[CUMULATE]] implements several inference mechanisms to produce assertions about user's knowledge and progress, including the following.\n* time-spent-reading (reading texts via [[Knowledge Sea II]] and [[AnnotatEd]])\n* thresholded averaging (browsing examples via [[WebEx]] and exploring expressions via [[WADEIn]])\n* [[CUMULATE asymptotic knowledge assessment|asymptotic assessment of user knowledge]] (problem solving via [[QuizPACK]], [[QuizJET]], and [[SQLKnoT]], which is the main one deployed in our systems)\n* [[CUMULATE parametrized asymptotic knowledge assessment|parametrized asymptotic assessment of user knowledge]] (<span style="color:maroon;">under development</span>)\n* knowledge tracing (<span style="color:maroon;">under consideration</span>)\n* [[Feature-Aware Student knowledge Tracing (FAST)|Feature-Aware Student knowledge Tracing (FAST)]] (<span style="color:maroon;">under development</span>)\n\n== Modeling User's Knowledge ==\n[[Image:CUMULATE.evidence propagation.png|thumb|'''100'''|Evindence propagation in CUMULATE]]\n[[CUMULATE]] models user's knowledge of concepts with respect to the following levels of [http://www.officeport.com/edu/blooms.htm Bloom's taxonomy].\n* knowledge - corresponds to reading tutorials or book chapters ([[Knowledge Sea II]], [[AnnotatEd]])\n* comprehension - reviewing examples, watching demos ([[WebEx]], [[WADEIn]] demo mode)\n* application - answering quiz questions ([[QuizPACK]], [[QuizJET]], [[WADEIn]] evaluation mode)\n* synthesis - constructing problem solutions ([[SQLKnoT]])\nUpon receipt of new information about user activity (interaction with a learning object), [[CUMULATE]] first verifies the integrity of the reported information (user is registered, learning object provider is known and learning object exists, etc.). Then, based on the learning object provider and result of interaction, it is determined what inference mechanism to use and what [http://www.officeport.com/edu/blooms.htm Bloom's level] to affect. [[CUMULATE]] then looks up the domain concepts for the learning object the user interacted with and performs the update of the knowledge. Summaries of progress with learning objects are updated as well. The process of updating user model is called '''evidence propagation''' (see figure on the left).<br/>\n\n<span style="color:red;">New!</span> Recent update to [[CUMULATE]] allows learning object providers to skip learning object metadata lookup and report changes in user's knowledge of domain concepts directly.\n\n== Entry Points and Protocols ==\n[[CUMULATE]] has 3 major entry points:\n# interface for reporting user interaction with learning objects\n# interface for reporting changes to user knowledge of concepts in-the-raw (<span style="color:red;">new</span>)\n# interface for acquiring models of user knowledge/progress as a whole or in part\n\nTo communicate with these entry points, a Web-based personalized learning system has to use a set of standard user modeling protocols known as [[CUMULATE protocol|CUMULATE protocols]].\n\n==Publications==\n<onlyinclude>\n* Zadorozhny, V., [[User:myudelson|Yudelson, M.]], and [[User:peterb|Brusilovsky, P.]] (2008) '''A Framework for Performance Evaluation of User Modeling Servers for Web Applications'''.

Progress is described in terms of: 1) now many steps of the learning objet were explored, 2) how many attempts user has made while exploring. Information about user progress can be requested in XML format and in the format of Java serialized objects.\n\n== Getting user progress report in an XML format ==\nThis protocol allows requesting user progress with a set of learning objects in an XML format. The set of learning objects are constrained by specifying application that serves learning objects and possibly a scope - group of learning objects within that application. In addition to individual user progress an average user progress can be requested (for example to implement social navigation).\n\n'''Request URL Format:'''\n<pre>http://<report_manager>?typ=<information_type>&dir=<upload_request>&frm=<format>&app=<application_id>&usr=<user>&gpr=<group>&scp=<scope></pre>\n\n,where:\n\n* '''typ''' – '''mandatory''', type of report, here should always be '''act''' (user action, learning object)\n* '''dir''' – '''mandatory''', direction of communication with report manager, should always be '''out''' (report manager only sending information nothing is taken in) for GET requests\n* '''frm''' – '''mandatory''', format, e.g. for xml report should be '''xml'''\n* '''app''' – '''mandatory''', application id, for a list of valid application ids refer to section [[#Parameter Naming Conventions|Parameter Naming Conventions]]\n* '''usr''' – '''mandatory''', user who's progress report is requested\n* '''grp''' – '''mandatory''', user group, if present an average group report will be added to individual user report\n\n'''Example request URL:'''\n<pre>http://adapt2.sis.pitt.edu/cbum/ReportManager?typ=act&dir=out&frm=xml&app=2&usr=myudelson&grp=200721</pre>\n\n'''XML Example:'''\nBelow is an example of the returned XML, where learning object 2dimensional_array1 with 3 steps: 1, 2, and 3 that have been performed 25, 12, and 3 times respectively and the user progress for those steps is .3, .2, and .1 respectively.\nIn addition CUMULATE lets you know several other things:\n* the number of users in the group via '''member_count''' attribute of '''group''' tag (here 30)\n* the date-time of the most recent user transaction registered by CUMULATE for this user via '''user-hash''' tag\n* the date-time of the most recent user transaction registered by CUMULATE for this user and the application specified via '''user-app-hash''' tag\n<pre>\n<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>\n<report>\n   <user>myudelson</user>\n   <user-app-hash>2007-11-07 16:30:54.497</user-app-hash>\n   <user-hash>2007-11-28 12:03:45.250</user-hash>\n   <group member_count="30">200721</group>\n   <activities>\n      <activity>\n         <name>2dimensional_array1</name>\n         <subactivity>\n            <name>0</name>\n            <individual>\n               <count>25</count>\n               <progress>0.3</progress>\n            </individual>\n         </subactivity>\n         <subactivity>\n            <name>1</name>\n            <individual>\n               <count>12</count>\n               <progress>0.2</progress>\n            </individual>\n         </subactivity>\n         <subactivity>\n            <name>2</name>\n            <individual>\n               <count>3</count>\n               <progress>0.1</progress>\n            </individual>\n         </subactivity>\n      </activity>\n      ...\n   </activities>\n</report>\n</pre>\n\n[[#top|^top]]\n\n== Getting user progress report in the format of Java serialized objects ==\nThis protocol works in a similar fashion as the one in the previous section [[#Getting user progress report in an XML format| Getting user progress report in an XML format]].

0	Systems	Our group explores several kinds of information systems focused mostly on personalized systems (such as adaptive learning and recommender systems) and various kinds of systems that support human navigation in information space (such as adaptive hypermedia and social navigation). This page presents a brief overview of the types of systems we explore and follows with a quick overview of the systems and frameworks developed at [[Main Page|PAWS]] lab.\nThis page presents the main types of topics and technologies explored by PAWS Lab. Like other Wiki pages, it is permanently in construction.\n\n= System Types =\n\n== Personalized Learning Systems ==\n\nPersonalized learning technologies provide an alternative to the dominant “one-size-fits-all” approach to treating diverse student audiences. While having a relatively long history, this research direction moved to the forefront only recently when modern information technologies opened new learning opportunities for a wide range of students. Nowadays, personalized learning is considered to be a top priority research direction by many experts. For example, [http://www.engineeringchallenges.org/cms/8996/9127.aspx advanced personalized learning] was named among [http://www.engineeringchallenges.org/ 14 Grand Challenges for Engineering] along with preventing nuclear terror and making solar energy economical. It has also been listed among the highest funding priorities in [http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2010/2/69358-assessing-the-changing-us-it-rd-ecosystem/fulltext Communications of the ACM].\n\nPersonalized learning technologies enable e-learning systems to maintain a model of the goals, preferences and knowledge of each student and apply this model to adapt the system performance to the student making the learning process more efficient and enjoyable. In so doing, various kinds of personalized e-learning systems demonstrated their ability to help students acquire knowledge faster, improve learning outcomes, reduce navigational overhead, and increase student engagement. Our team is interested a range of personalized learning technologies, focusing on modeling learner knowledge of the subject. Individual models of learner knowledge that our systems maintain are used to guide learners to the most appropriate learning content using course sequencing and adaptive navigation support technologies. Some systems also use the models to deliver adaptive visualization. Below is the list of personalized learning systems developed by our group. Most of these systems are open for anyone to use and explore online.\n\nMore at [[Personalized Learning Systems]]\n\nSystems:\n* [[QuizGuide]]\n* [[NavEx]]\n* [[Database Exploratorium]]\n* [[KnowledgeZoom]]\n* [[MasteryGrids]]\n* [[Mastery_Grids_Interface]] \n* [[JavaGuide]]\n* [[Progressor]]\n* [[ProgressorPlus]]\n\n== Smart Learning Content for Computing Education ==\n\nTo support our research on personalized learning, we developed several types of [[Smart Content]] for Computing Education. Smart content engages students in various kinds of interaction - exploration, simulation, problem solving - and use a rich trace of learning data generated by students interacting with this content to better model learner's knowledge. For some types of smart content activities we have authoring and delivery systems, other types are just collection of items, which you could use but can't edit.

0	ADAPT2	== Overview ==\n[[Image:adapt2-arcitecture.gif|thumb|'''100'''|ADAPT<sup>2</sup> Architecture]]\n\n[[ADAPT2|ADAPT<sup>2</sup>]] (read adapt-square) - Advanced Distributed Architecture for Personalized Teaching and Training - is a framework for research on personalized and adaptive learning, which brings together researchers exploring novel types of interactive learning content with researchers exploring various kinds of personalization approaches. As a part of its mission, [[ADAPT2|ADAPT<sup>2</sup>]] currently provides personalized learning systems to support large classes for several computer science education topics such as Java, Python, and SQL. It has been used in many universities on four continents.\n\n[[ADAPT2|ADAPT<sup>2</sup>]] consists of the following principal component types.\n* Portals, such as [[Knowledge Tree]], which provide a single sign-on point for users of personalized learning systems\n* User-modeling servers such as[[CUMULATE]], which maintain knowledge models of individual students\n* Content Servers, which provide access to various kinds of interactive learning objects \n* Adaptive Shells, which offer various kinds of personalized access to learning objects\n* [[PERSEUS]] - personalization service engine\n\nTo provide personalized service to its end users, these components communicate with each other using several standard communication protocols. Two main groups of protocols are [[Content Invocation protocols]], which enable a portal or an adaptive shell to call interactive learning objects residing on various content servers, and [[CUMULATE protocol|User Modeling protocols]] for reporting user activities and requesting current state of their knowledge from user-modeling servers.\n\nA typical personalized learning system supported by [[ADAPT2|ADAPT<sup>2</sup>]] works in the following way:\n\n* Students log in through a portal, such as [[Knowledge Tree]] or a regular learning management system, which determines which courses (learning groups) they can access. To start learning, students choose one of these courses. \n* A selected course provides access to one or more adaptive shells, such as [[MasteryGrids]]. Each of these shells provides personalized access to multiple kinds of learning content made accessible for the course. The selected course also determines which student modeling server will be used for personalization.\n* Using the current state of the user models, which the adaptive shell requests from the user-modeling server, the shell helps each student find and launch an interactive learning object that is most appropriate for the current state of their knowledge. \n* While the students work with the selected interactive learning object, all their activities are reported back to the user-modeling server, which uses these activities to update the state of individual learners' knowledge.\n* After completing their work with each learning object, the students return to the adaptive shell, which now uses the updated state of the user model to assist the learners with selecting the next knowledge- and context-appropriate learning object.\n\nThe personalized learning process supported by [[ADAPT2|ADAPT<sup>2</sup>]] is quite typical for personalized learning. The difference made by [[ADAPT2|ADAPT<sup>2</sup>]] is the ability to integrate components developed by multiple research teams. A research team exploring specific kind of learning objects could release them in a new content server and re-use other components (portals, user-modeling servers, adaptive shells) to explore these objects in a realistic context along with other types of objects. A team that explores new approaches for user modeling or personalization could develop new types of user-modeling servers and adaptive shells and reuse components developed by other teams. [[ADAPT2|ADAPT<sup>2</sup>]] promotes collaboration and enables each team to focus on the type of learning technology that they want to explore.\n\nThe original design of the [[ADAPT2|ADAPT<sup>2</sup>]] architecture was presented in the following papers:\n* Brusilovsky, P. and Nijhawan, H. (2002) A Framework for Adaptive E-Learning Based on Distributed Re-usable Learning Activities. In: M. Driscoll and T. C. Reeves (eds.) Proceedings of World Conference on E-Learning, E-Learn 2002, Montreal, Canada, October 15-19, 2002, AACE, pp. 154-161.Brusilovsky, P. (2004) KnowledgeTree: A distributed architecture for adaptive e-learning. In:  Proceedings of 13th International World Wide Web Conference, WWW 2004, New York, NY, 17-22 May, 2004, ACM Press, pp. 104-113.\n* Brusilovsky, P., Sosnovsky, S., and Yudelson, M. (2004) Adaptive Hypermedia Services for E-Learning. In:  Proceedings of Workshop on Applying Adaptive Hypermedia Techniques to Service Oriented Environments at the Third International Conference on Adaptive Hypermedia and Adaptive Web-Based Systems (AH'2004), Eindhoven, the Netherlands, August 23, 2004, Technische University Eindhoven, pp. 470-479.\n\nOver the years, the infrastructure has been expanded with support of several projects such as [[Personalized Access to Open Corpus Educational Resources through Adaptive Navigation Support and Adaptive Visualization]] and [[Adaptive Navigation Support and Open Social Learner Modeling for PAL]]. We developed several adaptive shells to explore a range of personalization approaches and collaborated with many research teams to offer a broad set of interactive learning objects for computer science education. Currently, we are integrating [[ADAPT2|ADAPT<sup>2</sup>]] into a larger community-oriented infrastructure that is being developed by NSF-supported Infrastructure project [[Community-Building and Infrastructure Design for Data-Intensive Research in Computer Science Education]].\n\n== Knowledge Tree ==\n{|\n| valign="top" | [[Image:KnowledgeTreeLogo.gif|thumb|left|'''100'''|Knowledge Tree]]\n| valign="top" | [[Knowledge Tree]] is a link aggregating portal. It presents content structured according to the folder-document paradigm. [[Knowledge Tree]] provides authentication and authorization and implements a simplified form of access control. It supports collaborative authoring and social annotation. ([[Knowledge Tree|more]])\n|}\n\n== CUMULATE ==\n[[CUMULATE]] is a central user modeling server responsible for collecting evidence of user activity and for generating user models, i.e., assertions about the knowledge and mastery of individual users. Personalization components of the architecture, such as personalized shells and personalized learning content, could get access to the user models (using CUMULATE protocols) to offer personalized access and other personalized services to the end users. ==> ([[CUMULATE|more]] on CUMULATE)\n\n== Adaptive Shells ==\nADAPT2 supports multiple types of adaptive shells (aka value-adding services) which are the key components for providing adaptation and personalization. Adaptive shells stand between a portal and learning objects coming from multiple content servers. In contrast to the portal, which is not personalized, adaptive shells can provide personalized access to learning objects. The ability to insert various adaptive shells between the portal and the learning content makes possible to explore various personalization approaches. Examples of adaptive shells explored by our lab in the past include:\n* [[NavEx]] for concept-based personalization\n* [[QuizGuide]] and [JavaGUide]] for topic-based personalization\n* [[Knowledge Sea II]] for social navigation support\n* [[Progressor]] shells for a single-content social comparison\n* [[ProgressorPlus|Progressor+]] shell for multi-type social comparison\n\nSince 2015 most of our research uses [[MasteryGrids]] shell. [[MasteryGrids]] offers a flexible and customizable interface for delivering and exploring personalized content access. It combines knowledge-based personalization explored by [[NavEx]] and [[QuizGuide]] with social navigation and comparison ideas explored by [[Knowledge Sea II]], [[Progressor]], and [[ProgressorPlus|Progressor+]].\n\n== Content Servers ==\nContent servers provide learning objects for students to interact with. Content servers that natively work with [[ADAPT2|ADAPT<sup>2</sup>]] include several systems developed by PAWS lab: [[WebEx]], [[QuizPACK]], [[WADEIn|c/jWADEIn]], [[SQLKnoT]], [[QuizJET]], [[PCEX]].\nADAPT2 can also use learning objects developed by many other research teams. There are currently two ways to make interactive learning content usable in ADAPT2. \n* For unrestricted use, learning content server has to implement with [[ADAPT2|ADAPT<sup>2</sup>]] content invocation protocol and CUMULATE knowledge reporting protocols. Examples of of content servers that implement these protocols are [http://ictg.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz:8000/ SQL Tutor] (University of Canterbury, New Zealand), [https://mcs.utm.utoronto.ca/~pcrs/pcrs/ PCRS] (University of Toronto), and [[ACOS server]] (Aalto University).\n\n* For the use in [[MasteryGrids]] interface only, a learning content server has to implement [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_Tools_Interoperability LTI protocol] for launching learning activities and reporting learner progress. Examples of LTI-compatible learning content that are currently used in courses supported by [[ADAPT2|ADAPT<sup>2</sup>]] are [https://codeworkout.cs.vt.edu/ CodeWorkout] (Virginia Tech) and [https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3125659.3125688 DBQA] (University of St. Thomas).\n\n== ADAPT2 Protocols ==\n\nCommunication protocols enable multiple components of [[ADAPT2|ADAPT<sup>2</sup>]] to work together in a coordinated way. A new component could be easily integrated into the infrastructure as long as it communicates with other components using these standardized protocols.\nTwo main groups of [[ADAPT2|ADAPT<sup>2</sup>]] protocols are \n* [[Content Invocation protocols]], which enable a portal or an adaptive shell to call interactive learning objects residing on various content servers\n* [[CUMULATE protocol|User Modeling protocols]] for reporting user activities and requesting the current state of their knowledge from user-modeling servers.\n\n== PERSEUS ==\n[[Image:Perseus.gif|thumb|100px|PERSEUS]]\n[[PERSEUS]] is a Personalization Service Engine. It provides adaptive support for non-personalized (educational) hypermedia systems by abstracting content presentation/aggregation from user modeling. [[PERSEUS]] protocols are based on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rdf RDF] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_(file_format)#RSS_1.0 RSS 1.0]. Although, [[PERSEUS]] was initially developed for [[ADAPT2|ADAPT<sup>2</sup>]] framework, its data model permits seamless support of any other hypermedia application. Currently [[PERSEUS]] supports social navigation, topic-based navigation, concept-based navigation, and adaptive filtering techniques.\n\n==Standardization ==\nData models of [[ADAPT2|ADAPT<sup>2</sup>]] components are partially serialized as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework RDF]. For more information refer to [[ADAPT2 RDF Binding|ADAPT<sup>2</sup> RDF Binding]].\n\n== Contacts ==\n* [[User:peterb | Peter Brusilovsky]]\n* [[User:Myudelson | Michael V.

0	QuizGuide	== About QuizGuide ==\n\nQuizGuide (Brusilovsky et al., 2004), an adaptive front-end to a collection of interactive self-assessment questions in the domain of C programming. The domain model in QuizGuide is formed by 22 topics such as variables, constants or character processing (Figure 3a). The system is able to model learner knowledge independently by topic and visualize the state of this learner model through adaptive annotation of link using the “target-arrow” icons (Figure 1). The number of arrows in the target reflects the level of knowledge the student has acquired on the topic: the more arrows the target has, the higher the level of knowledge. The intensity of the target’s color shows the relevance of the topic to the current learning goal: the more intense the color is, the more relevant the topic. This interface combined successful features of open learner models and navigation support: it provides a clear presentation of student knowledge by topic while also helping the student to select the optimal topic to work (one that is ready to be explored, but still not mastered).\n\nDespite a relatively simple adaptation approach, the navigation support provided by QuizGuide resulted in a remarkable impact on student performance and motivation to work with the system. In comparison with QuizPACK (Brusilovsky & Sosnovsky, 2005b), an earlier version of the system which provided access to the same quizzes with no navigation support, the average knowledge gain (a difference between post-test and pre-test results on a 10-point test) for the students using QuizGuide increased from 5.1 to 6.5. By guiding students to the right topics at the right time, the system caused a significant increase in the percentage of correctly answered questions from 35.6% to 44.3% (Brusilovsky & Sosnovsky, 2005a). Most remarkable, however, was an increase in the students’ interest in working with the system. The number of attempts, the percentage of students using the system actively, and the percentage of attempted topics increased significantly (Brusilovsky & Sosnovsky, 2005a). A re-implementation of QuizGuide’s adaptive navigation support approach in [[SQLGuide]] for SQL (Sosnovsky et al., 2008) and [[JavaGuide]] for Java programming (Hsiao et al., 2009) confirmed this impact in two other domains.\n\nThe first version of QuizGuide offered navigation support on the level of topics only. as a result, it provided no support for selecting a specific problem within a topic - all of them were identical from the prospect of the system (i.e., all could contribute to the student knowledge of the topic). To address this problem, we added concept-level student modeling to the system using C programming ontology developed by our group. The ability to track student knowledge on the concept level allowed QuizGuide to provide independent navigation support for every problem offering students an estimation of how much knowledge about the concepts engaged in the problem has already been obtained.\n\n== Publications ==\n* Brusilovsky, P., Sosnovsky, S., and Shcherbinina, O.

QuizJET randomly generates a question parameter, creates a presentation of the parameterized question in a Web-based quiz, compares student's input to the correct answer which QuizJET runs the parameterized code "behind the stage", and records the results into a server-side database. There are several assessment types deployed in QuizJET, including examining the final value of the variable and the printouts etc. The quizzes and questions can be authored through the unified Example Authoring interface, which is also used in other projects within our research group. The parameterized functionality inherits from [[QuizPACK]] . However, in order to cover more object-oriented programming concepts, QuizJET integrates more comprehensive knowledge, such as object, classes etc. There are three major designs in QuizJET differ from QuizPACK. 1) the assessment domain knowledge is in Java. 2) the question is always presented in the first tab page as the Driver Class. Imported classes will be presented accordingly. 3) imported classes are not limited and can be reused flexibly. QuizJET questions have been integrated in several personalized systems such as [[JavaGuide]], [[QuizMap]], [[Progressor]], and [[Mastery Grids]].\n\n== Interface ==\n[[Image:Quizjet.gif|QuizJET]]\n\n== Publications ==\n<onlyinclude>\n* [[User:shoha99 | Hsiao, I-H.]], [[User:peterb | Brusilovsky, P.]] & Sosnovsky, S.

0	PERSEUS	== Overview ==\n[[Image:Perseus.gif|thumb|100px|PERSEUS]]\n[[PERSEUS]] is a Personalization Service Engine. It provides adaptive support for non-personalized (educational) hypermedia systems by abstracting content presentation/aggregation from user modeling. [[PERSEUS]] protocols are based on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rdf RDF] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_(file_format)#RSS_1.0 RSS 1.0]. Although, [[PERSEUS]] was initially developed for [[ADAPT2|ADAPT<sup>2</sup>]] framework, its data model permits seamless support of any other hypermedia application. Currently [[PERSEUS]] provides social navigation support, topic-based navigation support, concept-based navigation support, and adaptive recommendation.\n\n== Architecture ==\n[[Image:Perseus_architecture.png|thumb|100px|PERSEUS Architecture]]\n[[PERSEUS]] resides between the user interface (e.g. portal) and the user modeling server. The major sources of information for it are the content model (structure of the adapted hyperspace) and the user model (information about users). [[PERSEUS]] is comprised of three major components: adaptation strategies, visualization model, and data model. \n\n'''Data model''' plays a central role in structuring the process of acquiring data from the environment. Items of data model – called data contexts – contain several types of information. These include addresses of the user modeling servers for acquiring the user data, access points to data stores (relational and/or semantic), URIs and URLs marking entry points to data stores, URI/URL patterns to filter/select resources of interest in the content model, etc. \n\n'''Adaptation strategies''' (or [personalization] services ) are the scenarios used to produce the adaptation. They prescribe what kind of data should be obtained from the available sources and how it should be processed. The sources are specified in data contexts or could be the results of other adaptation strategy (chained adaptations). Relative independence of adaptation strategies allows them to be (re-)used with multiple data contexts.\n\n'''Visualization model''' is comprised of special entities called visualizers. Visualizers contain rules prescribing how the continuous data produced by adaptation strategies (for example various measures of interest, importance, knowledge, etc.) can be presented to the user. Often these rules control how ranges of continuous values are mapped to discrete visual annotations. Visualizers, just like the data contexts are relatively independent from adaptation strategies. Different visualizers can be selectively used with one adaptation strategy and also the same visualizer to be used with different adaptation strategies.\n\n== Adaptation Strategies ==\nBelow are the schematic representations of the three major adaptation techniques implemented in [[PERSEUS]]: social-based, topic-based, and concept-based navigation.\n<gallery perrow="3" widths="150">\nImage:Perseus-service-social.png|Schema of social-based navigation in [[PERSEUS]]\nImage:Perseus-service-topic.png|Schema of  topic-based navigation in [[PERSEUS]]\nImage:Perseus-service-concept.png|Schema of concept-based navigation in [[PERSEUS]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Publications==\n<onlyinclude>\n\n* [[User:myudelson|Yudelson, M.]] (2010) '''Providing Service-based Personalization in an Adaptive Hypermedia System'''.

There are three stages of a complete example annotating process. The first stage is to author the annotation of the example. The second stage is to peer review others' work by providing ratings/comments on the example annotations. The third stage is to re-annotate the example annotations. The annotated examples will not only be presented through AnnotEx itself, but also WebEx and  [[NavEx]].\n\n==Screenshots==\n[[Image:AnnotEx.gif|AnnotEx]]\n\n==Pubications==\n[[Publications]] related to AnnotEx\n\n==Contacts==\n[[User:shoha99 | Sharon, I-Han Hsiao]]

This system basically utilizes human psychology to conform to opinions of friends. When people go to a music concert or exhibition, they commonly ask their friends' opinions, and invite them to go along. Centered on this trusted human network, users can recommend items to their friends and rate their friends' taste about a certain genre of cultural events. This system is to cope with various problems of traditional collaborative filtering technique such as ad-hoc user problem (users copying other users' profile), data sparsity, blackship users and system scalability.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n[[Image:Pittcult.gif]]\n\n<br/>\n* For more information, please visit [http://pittcult.sis.pitt.edu/help.jsp here] or contact [[User:suleehs | Danielle Lee]]\n\n* [[Publications#PittCult|Publications]] related with PittCult

0	TaskSieve	In this system, a special type of the user model is supported called as a task model. It is aimed at supporting information analysts who are required to solve a specific task. A very short term user model is constructed to model each different user task and personalization is made with the task models. A post filtering approach was applied to this purpose. The ad-hoc retrieval results triggered by user queries were re-ordered using the task model so that more relevant documents to the task model should be ranked up in the lists. In terms of the interface, we added a control with which users can control the effects of the query and the task model according to their needs and the context.\n[[Image:TaskSieve.png|frame|center|TaskSieve system]]\n\n== Publications ==\n<onlyinclude>\n* Ahn, J., Brusilovsky, P., He, D., Grady, J., and Li, Q.

This formula reflects the following principles.\n* there are several domain concepts (knowledge items, rules, productions) involved in solving a problem; the knowledge of each of them is updated proportionally to the others\n* knowledge is updated only upon correct user answers, there is no penalty for errors\n* solving a problem correctly multiple times will result in diminishing update (growth) of the knowledge level of the concepts as the number of successes grows\n[[Image:CUMULATE asymptotic knowledge assessment.png]], where\n* ''Ko'' - is the starting level of knowledge (here we always start from 0)\n* ''res'' - result of user action (0 -error, 1 - correct); \n* ''Wc,p'' - is a weight of concept ''c'' in problem ''p''\n* &Sigma;''Wc,p'' - is the sum of weights of all concepts in problem ''p''\n* ''<sub>succ</sub>att<sub>p</sub>'' - is a number of successful solutions to problem p prior to current attempt\n\n=Examples=\nBelow is a graph of concept's knowledge level growth vs. number of successful attempts to apply it.

Namely:\n* the initial knowledge level (''Ko'') can only start from 0\n* the speed of knowledge growth cannot be adjusted (e.g. slow for hard concepts, fast for easy concepts)\n* problem repetition penalty is not adjustable as well\nAs a result modeling is done in the same way for all users solving all problems. No special attention is given to individual user differences and individual problem complexity.\n\nOne of the ways to overcome these shortcomings is an attempt to create a [[CUMULATE parametrized asymptotic knowledge assessment|parameterizable]] version of this algorithm.\n\n= Contacts =\n[[User:Myudelson | Michael V.

0	CUMULATE_parametrized_asymptotic_knowledge_assessment	[[CUMULATE]]'s [[CUMULATE parametrized asymptotic knowledge assessment|parameterized asymptotic knowledge assessment]] algorithm is an attempt to overcome shortcomings of its [[CUMULATE asymptotic knowledge assessment|non-paramterized]] version. Namely, ''one-fits-all'' nature, prohibiting parameter tuning for individual users' abilities and problem complexities.\n\n=Computation=\nThe formula below is used to update the knowledge levels of concepts (''c'') addressed in a problem (''p''). This formula reflects the following principles (identical to the [[CUMULATE asymptotic knowledge assessment|predecessor]] algorithm).\n* there are several domain concepts (knowledge items, rules, productions) involved in solving a problem; the knowledge of each of them is updated proportionally to the others\n* knowledge is updated only upon correct user answers, there is no penalty for errors\n* solving a problem correctly multiple times will result in diminishing update (growth) of the knowledge level of the concepts as the number of successes grows\nin addition:\n* the initial level of knowledge, speed of knowledge growth, and penalty for repetitive (correct) solutions to the problem - are now adjustable parameters\n[[Image:CUMULATE parameterized asymptotic knowledge assessment.png]], where\n* ''Ko'' - is the starting level of knowledge, ''Ko'' &isin; [0, 1]\n* ''res'' - result of user action (0 -error, 1 - correct); \n* ''Wc,p'' - is a weight of concept ''c'' in problem ''p''\n* &Sigma;''Wc,p'' - is the sum of weights of all concepts in problem ''p''\n* ''<sub>succ</sub>att<sub>p</sub>'' - is a number of successful solutions to problem ''p'' prior to current attempt\n* ''pV'' - speed of knowledge growth parameter, ''pV'' &isin; [0, 1]\n* ''OPP'' - over-practicing parameter, controlling the penalty for repetitively solving one problem (correctly), ''OPP'' &isin; [0, 1]\n\n=Examples=\n\n==Example 1==\nBelow is a graph of concept's knowledge level growth and the penalty coefficient vs. number of successful attempts to apply it in a problem. The lines denote:\n* the blue line denotes a successful use of a concept in a new problem (''pV'' = .5)\n* the green line denotes a penalty coefficient -- 1/''(<sub>succ</sub>att<sub>p</sub>''+2)''<sup>OPP</sup>'' -- as if it was the same problem (''OPP'' = .25)\n* the red line ''merges'' the two graphs above\n[[Image:CUMULATE parameterized asymptotic knowledge assessment - knowledge growth and penalty.png]]\n<br/>\n([http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=lxy&chs=300x240&chd=t:0,10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100%7C00,50,75,88,94,97,98,99,100,100,100%7C-1%7C-1,100,84,76,71,67,64,61,59,58,56%7C-1%7C00,50,63,66,66,65,63,61,59,58,56&chco=24588E,4C9B46,CF1E2B&chxt=x,y&chxl=1:%7C0%7C.2%7C.4%7C.6%7C.8%7C1%7C0:%7C0%7C1%7C2%7C3%7C4%7C5%7C6%7C7%7C8%7C9%7C10&chm=o,24588E,0,-1,10%7Co,4C9B46,1,-1,10%7Co,CF1E2B,2,-1,10&chg=10,20&chdl=knowledge+level%7Cpenalty+coefficient%7Cresulting+curve&chdlp=b+&chls=1,1,0%7C1,1,0%7C3,6,3&chtt=Knowledge+level+growth+and+change+in+penalty%7Ccoefficient+vs.+number+of+successful+attempts&chdlp=b alternatively] via [http://code.google.com/apis/chart/ Google Chart API])\n\n==Example 2==\nBelow: the speed of problem learning is held constant (''pV'' = .5) while the penalty for practicing the same problem changes.\n\n[[Image:CUMULATE parameterized asymptotic knowledge assessment - knowledge growth for diff OPP.png]]\n<br/>\n([http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=lxy&chs=300x240&chd=t:0,10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100%7C0,50,75,87,93,97,98,99,100,100,100%7C-1%7C0,47,71,83,90,94,97,98,98,99,100%7C-1%7C0,42,64,77,85,89,93,95,96,97,98%7C-1%7C0,35,54,66,73,79,83,86,88,90,92%7C-1%7C0,30,45,55,62,67,70,74,76,78,80%7C-1%7C0,25,38,45,51,55,58,61,63,65,66&chco=24588E,4C9B46,F3A030,CF1E2B,78387B,7C807F&chxt=x,y&chxl=1:%7C0%7C.2%7C.4%7C.6%7C.8%7C1%7C0:%7C0%7C1%7C2%7C3%7C4%7C5%7C6%7C7%7C8%7C9%7C10&chm=o,24588E,0,-1,10%7Co,4C9B46,1,-1,10%7Co,F3A030,2,-1,10%7Co,CF1E2B,3,-1,10%7Co,78387B,4,-1,10%7Co,7C807F,5,-1,10&chg=10,20&chdl=OPP=.01%7COPP=.10%7COPP=.25%7COPP=.50%7COPP=.75%7COPP=1.0&chdlp=b&chtt=Knowledge+level+growth+for+different+penalty%7Cparameters+vs.+number+of+successful+attempts alternatively] via [http://code.google.com/apis/chart/ Google Chart API])\n\n==Example 3==\nGraph below shows differences the growth of knowledge while speed of learning varies.

0	CUMULATE_user_and_domain_adaptive_user_modeling	This stream of work is aimed at improving [[CUMULATE]]'s [[CUMULATE asymptotic knowledge assessment|legacy]] ''one-fits-all'' algorithm for  modeling user's problem-solving activity and creating a context-sensitive user modeling algorithm adaptable/adaptive to individual users' cognitive abilities as well as to individual problem complexities.\n\nA new [[CUMULATE parametrized asymptotic knowledge assessment|parametrized]] user modeling algorithm has been devised. A set of studies is set up to evaluate the new algorithm as well as its adaptability/adaptivity.\n\n==Study 1==\nThis study involves retrospective comparative evaluation of the [[CUMULATE]]'s [[CUMULATE asymptotic knowledge assessment|legacy]] and [[CUMULATE parametrized asymptotic knowledge assessment|parametrized]] user modeling algorithms. The evaluation is done using [[CUMULATE_Usage_Logs#Database_Management_6_Course_Dataset|usage logs]] collected from 6 Database Management courses offered during Fall 2007 and Spring 2008 semesters at the [http://www.pitt.edu University of Pittsburgh], [http://www.ncirl.ie National College of Ireland], and [http://www.dcu.ie Dublin City University]. Each course had roughly the same structure and an identical set of problems served by [[SQLKnoT]] system.\n\n=== Scenario ===\nWe were comparing [[CUMULATE asymptotic knowledge assessment|legacy]] CUMULATE algorithm and 3 versions of [[CUMULATE parametrized asymptotic knowledge assessment|parametrized]] algorithm. The versions differed in the parameters used for user modeling.\n* First, was an attempt to shadow the [[CUMULATE asymptotic knowledge assessment|legacy]] algorithm by ''guessing'' the best parameters for modeling, without discriminating individual user and problem differences.\n* The second version, did not discriminate users/problems as well. However, the parameters were obtained by fitting one global user parameter and one global problem parameter signature and then using them for the modeling.\n* The third version of the [[CUMULATE parametrized asymptotic knowledge assessment|parametrized]] algorithm worked with a set of user specific parameters and problem specific parameter signatures for the modeling.\n\n=== Procedures ===\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy Accuracy] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sum_of_squared_error SSE] (sum of squared error) were used as the metrics of comparison. They were computed overall for each of the 6 semester logs and 4 versions of algorithms.\n\nIn the case of [[CUMULATE asymptotic knowledge assessment|legacy CUMULATE]] and [[CUMULATE parametrized asymptotic knowledge assessment|parametrized CUMULATE]]-best-guess algorithms, the data was taken as it. The globally parametrized, and individually paramatrized CUMULATE algorithms were supplied with the pre-fit global/individual user/problem-specific parameters. The data of only one of the early courses was used to obtain the parameters. Data of all 6 was used to compute parametrized models.

0	Blending_layers_of_CUMULATE's_user_model	{{ambox| text='''This page is under construction. More content will be added soon'''|type=exclamation}}\n\nThis work is focused on mutual influence of heterogeneous user activity types (reading texts, viewing examples, and solving problems) on user's knowledge of some educational domain. Ordinarily [[CUMULATE]]'s considers them separately by classifying them to modeling tiers or levels, each corresponding to a level of [http://www.officeport.com/edu/blooms.htm| Bloom's taxonomy] of intellectual behavior. Great part of this work is devoted on cross-tier user modeling. Namely, how user activity can (positively) influence on another/other layer(s).\n\n== Study 1 ==\nIn this study we have inspected the influence of the comprehension layer of [[CUMULATE]]'s user model (viewing examples) on the application layer (solving problems). Our approach was to create "blends" of problem-solving tier of the user model and weighted (from 0 to 1, with .1 step) example viewing tier Our hypotheses were that:\n* Using example browsing activity when modeling problem solving improves model accuracy\n* Different users benefit from different “blends” of user model levels\nIn addition we wanted to se if\n* There is a single optimal blend for all users, and. or\n* Classes of users benefitting from different model blends can be determined\n\n=== Data ===\nWe were using previously collected student [[CUMULATE_Usage_Logs#Database_Management_6_Course_Dataset|usage logs]] collected from 4 Database Management courses offered during Fall 2007 and Spring 2008 semesters at the [http://www.pitt.edu University of Pittsburgh] and [http://www.dcu.ie Dublin City University].

The criteria was that the user had to cover at least 33% of problems (15/48) and at least 33% of examples (15/64). For each of the qualified users 11 user models were computed: with 0% to 100% of example browsing activity "blended" to the problem solving (by % here we mean numerical weighting not item filtering).\n\n=== Metrics ===\n* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy Accuracy] was used to measure the resulting user model quality\n* For every user - the "best blend" - blended model (with 10% or more of example activity added) having the highest accuracy; if there is more than one such model, the smallest % of the blend is taken\n* For each user - number of "best blends" - number of blended models (with 10% blend of example activity or more), where the accuracy is the highest\n\n=== Results ===\n[[Image:Blending layers of CUMULATE's user model.

Study 1.histogram.png|thumb|'''100'''|Distribution of number of users for different "best" blends]]\n* While looking at users' individual preferences, the best user blend seems to be superior to the 0%-blend: t = -5.38, p-value<.001\n* Comparison of uniform blends for all users to a 0%-blends, shows that 40% and 50% blends were significantly better than 0%-blend: t = -for both 2.05, p-value = .023\n* User separation into groups by the number of best blends yielded the following results\n** <span style="color:grey;">'''''Low'''''. 1 best blend only, 2 users.

However, the abundance of available content produced at least two problems: how to help students to find the most appropriate resources and how to engage them into using these resources and benefit from them. Personalized and social learning have been suggested as potential ways to address these problems.\n\nThis work attempts to combine the ideas of personalized and social learning by providing navigation support through an open social student modeling visualization. A series of classroom studies exploited the idea of the approach and revealed promising results, which demonstrated the personalized guidance and social visualization combined helped students to find the most relevant resources of parameterized self-assessment questions for Java programming. Thus, this dissertation extend the approach to a larger collection of learning objects for cross content navigation and verify its capability of supporting social visualization for personalized E-Learning.\n\nThe study results confirm that working with the non-mandatory system, students enhanced the learning quality in increasing their motivation and engagement. They successfully achieved better learning results. Meanwhile, incorporating a mixed collection of content in the open social student modeling visualizations effectively led the students to work at the right level of questions. Both strong and weak student worked with the appropriate levels of questions for their readiness accordingly and yielded a consistent performance across all three levels of complexities. Additionally, providing a more realistic content collection on the navigation supported open social student modeling visualizations results in a uniform performance in the group. The classroom study revealed a clear pattern of social guidance, where the stronger students left the traces for weaker ones to follow. The subjective evaluation confirms the design of the interface in terms of the content organization. Students’ positive responses also compliment the objective system usage data.\n\ndownload it from [http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/13439/ here]\n\n==== <span id="2011-11-30">2011-11-30</span> :: [[User:Sergey | Sergey Sosnovsky]] Thesis Defence: Ontology-Based Open-Corpus Personalization for E-Learning  ====\nConventional closed-corpus adaptive information systems control limited sets of documents in fixed subject domains and cannot provide access to the content outside the system. Such restrictions contradict the requirements of today, when most of the information systems are implemented in the open document space of WWW and are expected to operate on the open-corpus content. In order to maintain personalized access to open-corpus documents, an adaptive system should be able to model the documents and the relations between the documents and the domain knowledge automatically and dynamically. This dissertation explores the problem of open-corpus personalization and semantic modeling of open-corpus content in the context of e-Learning. Information on WWW is not without structure. Many collections of online instructional material (tutorials, electronic books, digital libraries, etc.) have been provided with implicit knowledge models encoded in form of tables of content, indexes, headers of chapters, links between pages, and different styles of text fragments. The main dissertation approach tries to leverage this layer of hidden semantics by extracting and representing it as coarse-grained models of collections. A central domain ontology is used to maintain overlay modeling of studentsÕ knowledge and serves as a reference point for multiple collections of external instructional material. In order to establish the link between the ontology and the open-corpus content models a special ontology mapping algorithm has been developed.  The proposed approach has been applied in the Ontology-based Open-corpus Personalization Service (OOPS) that recommends and adaptively annotates online reading material. The domain of Java programming has been chosen for the proof-of-concept implementation. A controlled experiment has been organized to evaluate the developed adaptive system and the proposed approach overall. The results of the evaluation have demonstrated several significant learning effects of the implemented open-corpus personalization. The analysis of log-based data has also shown that the open-corpus version of the system is capable of providing personalization of similar quality to the close-corpus one. Such results indicate that the proposed approach supports fully-scale open-corpus personalization for e-Learning. Further research is required to verify if the approach remains effective in other subject domains and with other types of instructional content.\n\n==== <span id="2011-07-15">2011-07-15</span> :: [[User:DParra | Denis Parra]] earns a  James Chen Best Student paper award in UMAP 2011 ====\nIn the last conference of User Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization (UMAP 2011) Denis Parra won one of the 2 [http://www.umap2011.org/program/best-paper-awards James Chen Best Student paper awards] for his paper '''Walk The Talk: Analyzing the relation between implicit and explicit feedback for preference elicitation''' that he co-authored with Dr. Xavier Amatriain.

Consequently, the need has arisen to move from prototypical systems to scalable, deployable solutions. At the same time, a shift can be seen from rule-based, mentalistic user modeling approaches to 'Web 2.0' approaches that involve machine learning, data mining, and collaborative techniques. \n\nPast research provided a large body of methods for adaptation/personalization, and techniques for user modeling, usage mining, and collaborative filtering. Conceptual frameworks splitting the adaptation process into various layers provide guidance for implementing user-adaptive systems. Based on these building blocks, various groups have created their own frameworks, among others AHA!, APELS, and Personal Reader. Framework design provides an opportunity to reuse components or even whole layers of the adaptation process. Reuse of components such as user behavior observation and logging tools, user model storage promotes faster development, better feature selection, and more robust systems.\n\nAlthough, system fragmentation enables component reuse and speeds up the development of the new systems, there are several issues. First, decomposition of a monolithic system should result in a good abstraction of the data and process model to provide a convenient basis for reuse. Second, the data traffic between the separated system components may intensify. As the number of system users increases issues related to scalability might arise. This is especially true for user-adaptive and cognitive systems where the modeling and personalization components are traditionally computationally and data intensive. \n\nExisting work on the Web-based user-adaptive and cognitive systems, including work on frameworks, shown that there exists a strong overlap between conceptual models of the decomposed adaptation process and the practical implications of its design. In this situation, a logical step is to compare already working systems with emerging approaches and models. In this workshop we seek to identify current practices and experiences with concrete implementations of user-adaptive and cognitive systems or specific components - varying from experimental, small-scale prototypes to systems that are deployed on a larger scale.\n\n=Topics=\nTopics include but are not limited to: \n* user behavior observation and user data collection: embedded into the adaptive system or available as standalone components or add-ons, \n* user data management: data storage platforms and formats, the use of open standards, querying techniques or APIs, interoperability issues, \n* reusing reasoning and adaptation techniques,\n* scalability and performance issues of user modeling and adaptation, \n* generalizable techniques for adaptation, personalization and recommendation, \n* translations of conceptual designs into concrete implementation, \n* deployment issues and lessons learned (case studies and evaluation).\n\n=Proceedings=\nProceedings have been published at [http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-609 http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-609]\n\n=Call for papers=\n[[Media:Wabbwuas.umap2010.cfp.txt|TXT]] and [[Media:Wabbwuas.umap2010.cfp.pdf|PDF]]\n\n=Program=\n* 8:00 - 9:30\n** Generic Adaptation Process (long paper, 30min)<br/>''Evgeny Knutov, Paul De Bra and Mykola Pechenizkiy''\n** Towards a Generic Platform for Indoor Positioning using Existing Infrastructure and Symbolic Maps (short paper, 15min)<br/>''Kurt Gubi, Rainer Wasinger, Michael Fry, Judy Kay and Tsvi Kuflik''\n** Ontology-Driven Adaptive Accessible Interfaces in the INREDIS project (short paper, 15min)<br/>''Raul Minon, Amaia Aizpurua, Idoia Cearreta, Nestor Garay, Julio Abascal''\n** Building Blocks for User Modeling with data from the Social Web (short paper, 15min)<br/>''Fabian Abel, Nicola Henze, Eelco Herder, Geert-Jan Houben, Daniel Krause and Erwin Leonardi''\n* 9:30 - 10:00 Coffee break\n* 10:00 - 11:30\n** Student modeling services for hybrid web applications (long paper, 30 min)<br/>''Ivan Cruces, Monica Trella, Ricardo Conejo and Jaime Galvez''\n** PERSEUS – Personalization Services Engine (demo, 15 min)<br/>''Michael Yudelson''\n** Discussion (45min)\n* 11:30 - 1:00 Lunch\n\n=Important dates=\n\n* April 12, 2010 - Submissions due (23:59 pm Hawaiian time)\n* May 3, 2010 - Notification of acceptance\n* May 24, 2010 - Camera-ready versions due\n* June 21, 2010 - Workshop day\n\n=Submission=\nAll papers should represent original and unpublished work that is not currently under review.\n\nSubmission types\n* Full paper (12 pages maximum)\n* Short paper (6 pages maximum)\n* Demo (3 pages)\n\nFormat\n* LNCS instructions for authors can be found [http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-7-72376-0 here]\n\nSubmission procedure \n* Submit your contributions electronically in PDF format  via [http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wabbwuas2010 EasyChair]\n\nReview\n* Each submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the workshop program committee.\n* Papers will be evaluated according to their significance, originality, technical content, style, clarity  and relevance to the workshop.\n\nThere  will  be  no  separate  workshop  registration  fees.

0	Adaptive_VIBE	Adaptive VIBE is a variation of VIBE, a reference point-based spatial visualization algorithm.  It supports the visualization of user models as well as usual documents.  User model is displayed as a separate group of POIs (Points of Interests or reference points). Because it is located in distant positions from the query POIs, users can mediate visually between their explicit interests (queries) and the system estimated interests or search contents (user models).\n \n[[Image:VisualTaskSieve.png|800px|center|Adaptive VIBE integrated into the TaskSieve system]]\n\n== Publications ==\n<onlyinclude>\n* Ahn, J., and Brusilovsky, P.

0	PERSEUS_adaptation_for_Ensemble_project	= About Ensemble =\n[[Ensemble]]  is a new NSF NSDL Pathways project working to establish a national, distributed digital library for computing education. Our project is building a distributed portal providing access to a broad range of existing educational resources for computing while preserving the collections and their associated curation processes. We want to encourage contribution, use, reuse, review and evaluation of educational materials at multiple levels of granularity and we seek to support the full range of computing education communities including computer science, computer engineering, software engineering, information science, information systems and information technology as well as other areas often called “computing + X” or “X informatics.”\n\n= Overview =\n[[Image:Portal-group-social-navigation.png|thumb|'''100'''|Figure 1. Group-based social navigation]]\n[[Image:Portal-group-n-individual-social-navigation.png|thumb|'''100'''|Figure 2. Group-based and individual social navigation]]\nThe main goal of enhancing Ensemble portal (http://www.computingportal.org) with adaptation is to provide an extra value to the rich collection of resources that the portal is currently hosting. Out of a large set of possible adaptation techniques we selected the one that captures the social traits of portal users. Namely, visualizes users' browsing behaviors.\n\nIn Figure 1 there is a screenshot of an existing portal page with adaptive navigation cues added. Here green bullets of various shades denote the intensity of the users' click traffic: the darker the shade - the more clicks visits the page has. Here users are not distinguished from each other. Instead, a page-viewing behavior of a community of all portal users is visualized. Figure 2 is a more elaborate example where each individual user is contrasted to the rest of the community. The bullet background represents the whole user community, an the foreground person icon denotes an individual user.\n\nFor the adaptation to work, Ensemble portal has to "cooperate" with the adaptation providers. There are two components that are responsible for adaptation.\n# User modeling server [[CUMULATE]], that collects user page-viewing behavior. Portal should be able to send page-view events containing the viewed page URL and potentially additional information about the user.\n# Adaptation server [[PERSEUS]], that, upon request, renders a visualization of aggregated user viewing-behaviors collected by the user modeling server. Portal should be able to query [[PERSEUS]] to obtain navigation icons (just like those in figure 1 and 2) for links on a particular portal page (all or a subset). It should also to be able to parse the [[PERSEUS]]'s response and paste these icons on the rendered page.\n\n= Implementation =\n\n== Reporting users's page-views ==\nThis par is absolutely necessary. Adaptation requires a special kind of user-data processing and cannot be easily implemented as a plugin for Drupal (the basis for Ensemble portal). Portal has to send an HTTP GET request to the [[CUMULATE|user modeling server's]] listening url that contains:\n* URL of the page being viewed\n* Some form of user identity (e.g. client IP address or portal login). This information is optional but desirable to be able to support a more advanced adaptation such as the one in Figure 2.\n\n== Requesting adaptation ("easy", abandoned) ==\n[[Image:Ensemble-embedlet-browser.png|thumb|'''100'''|Figure 3. [[PERSEUS]] embedlet rendered in a browser]]\nAdaptation can be provided in a fairly painless manner by inserting '''embed''' HTML tags, just like those [http://www.youtube.com YouTube] offers. [[PERSEUS]]'s embedlet is, in some way, an iframe and [[PERSEUS]] assumes full responsibility to render links' presentation (see Figure 3 for an example of embedlet's rendering in a browser).\n\nThe use of these '''embedlets''' requires for the list of links adaptation is provided for to be cached in advance, so that the enumeration of links to be adaptively presented can be done in a concise manner and the invoked embedlet URL does not exceed 255 characters.\n\nEmbedlet could work in both group-based mode providing adaptation similar to the one shown in Figure 1, or group-and-individual mode, similar to the one shown in Figure 2.\n\n== Requesting adaptation ("hard", implemented) ==\nHere the Content Management System (CMS) has to be more engaged but the solution is more flexible.\n\nThe two requirements for the CMS that is has to be able to send a query to [[PERSEUS]] with a list of links to adapt and to be able to parse the response. Concrete format of the request/response is not important, since a special version of the adaptation services would be built for [[Ensemble]].\n\nThe following is a working draft for invoking [[PERSEUS]] adaptation (HTTP POST request is a must):\n* '''http://adapt2.sis.pitt.edu/pservice/service/ensemble-sn/invoke/ensemble-sn''' is a base URL of PERSEUS social navigation support service for [[Ensemble]]\n* HTTP POST should be used to invoke, HTTP GET to access a 'manual' mode for testing\n* '''user_id''' - user id login of the logged-in portal user; currently meta user '''meta_ensemble''' should be used\n* '''group_id''' group id, id of the portal community; currently meta community '''meta_group''' should be used\n* '''uri''' -  list of links to adapt; these are the links sent to CUMULATE with reports of user clicks; the list items should be separated by CR (carriage return)\n* '''vis_id''' - an id of a visualizer that formats the output by selecting appropriate annotations for the aggregated numerical values; at this point should be equal to '''ensemble-sn-shadeviz'''; alternatively '''/vis/ensemble-sn-shadeviz/''' could be added at the end of the base URL to achieve the same result, so the URL would be '''http://adapt2.sis.pitt.edu/pservice/service/ensemble-sn/invoke/ensemble-sn/vis/ensemble-sn-shadeviz'''\n* returned response is a list of annotations - HTML snippets (e.g. img tag and maybe something extra) to be placed in front of the link; the order of annotations is the same as in the request.\n\n== Relevant Links ==\n* [http://www.computingportal.org/ Ensemble Computing Portal]\n* [[CUMULATE_protocol|Protocol]] for exchanging data with [[CUMULATE]]'s user model, in particular - a [[CUMULATE_protocol#Protocol_for_reporting_user_activity|section]] on how to send clicks to the user model\n* [http://www.computingportal.org/admin/settings/navigation_cues Module for sending user clicks to CUMULATE settings page] (authentication necessary)\n\n= Progress Blog =\n* 13:49, 9 July 2010 (EDT) : Drupal Rules module identified as a way to redirect user clicks to [[CUMULATE]] UMS\n* 18:27, 15 July 2010 (EDT) : [[CUMULATE]] configured for accepting test input of Ensemble portal user navigation reports via [[CUMULATE_protocol#Protocol_for_reporting_user_activity|this]] protocol.

In this talk, he presents part of his research interest but in particular he talks about EventMaps, a system to help people manage conferences. Eventmaps has a purpose similar to our Conference Navigator, so we discussed about the possibility to work in conjunction with Dr. Wang.\n\n=== 2010-10-12 ===\nSharon (Blogger: Jennifer)\nMichael and Sharon enrich Knowledge Tree with recommendation and bookmarking. According to a user's behavior of bookmarking, the system could recommend diverse examples to the user. The bookmarking service functions independently and could be re-used across several system. A lot of recommendation algorithms could be tried on it. Besides, expanding collections of annotated examples is also what they can improve in the future.\n\n=== 2010-10-19 ===\nSherry <br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n(Blogger: Jennifer)<br/>\nJennifer rehearsed the paper which she is going to present in ASIS&T conference. Group members gave her some suggestions.<br/>\nSherry presented "Resource Recommendation for Social Tagging: A Multi-Channel Hybrid Approach" from RecSys'10 workshop. Although the hybrid solution suggested by the authors didn't really preform well in their three scenarios, we still could learn from them about their design methods and concerns. Multiple information channels are definitely worthy to exploit. While we are trying to engage some social resources into our systems, the nature of the resources, the nature of the users , the type of task that the system is intended to support and so on are required to be identified before implementating.\n\n=== 2010-10-26 ===\nNo meeting, Peter out of town.\n\n==November==\n\n=== 2010-11-2 ===\n- Cladia: <br/>\n- Jennifer: <br/>\n(Blogger: Danielle)\n\n=== 2010-11-9 ===\nDanielle (Blogger: Chirayu)\n\n=== 2010-11-16 ===\nChirayu (Blogger: Denis)\n\n=== 2010-11-23 ===\nDenis (Blogger: Sherry)\n[http://www.sis.pitt.edu/~dparra/PAWS_meetings/PAWS%20meeting_Fall%202010.pptx slides]\n* Presentation of paper: Improving the Presentation and Interpretation of Online Ratings Data with Model-Based Figures (2008) Daniel E.

0	Progressor	== Overview ==\n\nA large number of educational resources is now made available on the Web to support both regular classroom learning and online learning. However, the abundance of available content produced at least two problems: how to help students to find the most appropriate resources and how to engage them into using these resources and benefit from them. Personalized and social learning has been suggested as potential ways to address these problems. Progressor attempts to combine the ideas of personalized and social learning to help students find the\nmost relevant resources in a large collection of parameterized self-assessment questions for programming.\n\nProgressor is a collaboration work between [http://fusion.cs.uni-jena.de/professur University of Jena] and [http://adapt2.sis.pitt.edu/wiki University of Pittsburgh]. The core research goal of the project is to utilize the success of self-assessment programming language learning tool, [[QuizJET]], with rich-interaction interface derived from [http://www.minerva-portals.de/research/introspective-views IntrospectiveViews] and provide a better personalized visual access to programming language problems. The research investigates open social student model; how social guidance affects self-assessment programming language learning; motivational effects on the progress of educational content; privacy and data sharing and so on.\n\nWe are excited about what we've learnt from this project, we are now extending our approaches to a larger collection of learning objects for cross content navigation and verify its capability of supporting social visualization for personalized E-Learning, please refer to [http://adapt2.sis.pitt.edu/wiki/ProgressorPlus Progressor+]\n\n== Features ==\n* '''Learner Analytics''': question attempts, successful rates, overall progress etc.\n* '''Privacy management''': requests for accessing peers' models.\n* '''Interactivity''': interacting with the content, peers etc. from the visualization; allowing the user to feel in control.\n*''' Identity''': captures all the information belonging to the student and displays it in a unique model, allowing easy comparisons.\n* '''Exposure''': model thumbnails preview. We found that students had more persistent interactions with the system while they had higher visibilities.\n* '''Guidance''': implicit social guidance; (explicit social guidance is under investigation now)\n* '''Recommendation''': top 3 performers\n* '''Scalability''': we design a set of [[#Apply protocols the social visualization|protocols]] for reusing student progress data in various visualizations.\n\n== Apply protocols the social visualization==\n\nWe design the following protocols allows requesting user or group progress in JSON format. The protocol follows [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer REpresentational State Transfer(REST) architecture] and is an extension of [http://adapt2.sis.pitt.edu/wiki/CUMULATE_protocol CUMULATE protocol]. It provides the applicability for applying it to other social visualizations, such as [http://adapt2.sis.pitt.edu/wiki/ProgressorPlus Progressor+].\n\n'''The URL format for requesting particular user from a group with all his/her activities:'''\n<pre>\nhttp://adapt2.sis.pitt.edu/ktact/json/user/<the user login>/<the group name>\n\nExample:\nhttp://adapt2.sis.pitt.edu/ktact/json/user/shoha99/IS172011Spring\n</pre>\n\n* '''id''' – '''question rdfid''', this is the unique identifier for accessing the parameterized [http://adapt2.sis.pitt.edu/wiki/QuizJET QuizJET] question.\n* '''res''' – '''total number of correct tries''', this number indicates the successful attempts on this pattern of question.\n* '''attempt''' – '''total number of tries''', this number represents how many times the student has tried on this pattern of question.\n\n<pre>\n...\n   {\n      "id":"jVariables1",\n      "res":"6",\n      "attempt":"9"\n   },\n   {\n      "id":"jVariables2",\n      "res":"2",\n      "attempt":"3"\n   },\n...\n</pre>\n\n\n'''The URL format for requesting all students activities by group:'''\n<pre>\nhttp://adapt2.sis.pitt.edu/ktact/json/group/<the group name>\n\nExample:\nhttp://adapt2.sis.pitt.edu/ktact/json/group/IS172011Spring\n</pre>\n\n* '''id''' – '''student login''', this specifies the student's login.\n* '''name''' – '''student name'', this displays the student's name.\n* '''res''' – '''student average progress''', this number represents the student's average progress across topics.\n* '''topics''' – '''id''', topic names;  '''res''', topic average progress.\n\n<pre>\n{\n      "id":"shoha99",\n      "name":"Hsiao, Sharon (I-Han)",\n      "res":"0.126",\n      "topics":[\n         {\n            "id":"Variables",\n            "res":"0.8"\n         },\n        {\n            "id":"Objects",\n            "res":"0.2"\n         },\n        ...\n},\n{\n      "id":"xxxx",\n      "name":"lastName, firstName ",\n      "res":"0.107",\n      "topics":[\n         {\n            "id":"Variables",\n            "res":"0.00"\n         },\n         {\n            "id":"Objects",\n            "res":"0.2"\n         },\n         ...\n}\n...\n</pre>\n\n[[#top|^top]]\n\n== Screenshots ==\n\n<gallery perrow="3">\nImage:Progressor.png|Your personalized Progressor view\nImage:ProgressorAccessQuiz.png|Accessing to the quizzes or other educational material\nImage:ProgressorComparing.png|Comparing your own model with another or class on average\n</gallery>\n\n==Publications==\n<onlyinclude>\n* Bakalov, F., [[User:shoha99 | Hsiao, I-H.]], [[User:peterb | Brusilovsky, P.]], and König-Ries, B.

0	MEMA	The system is built upon a collection with approximately 80,000 \nphotographs by Charles "Teenie" Harris, a photographer for an \ninfluential local newspaper, the  Pittsburgh Courier. This \ncollection illustrates a 40-year period of Pittsburgh history \nthrough the eyes of an African-American photo-journalist and \namateur historian. MEMA stands for Museum Exhibition \nMAnagement. It is a system with mobile and Web features. To \nbe completely compatible for all mobile devices, we designed a \nmobile website with  flexible views for various mobile phone \nscreens. Users with handheld devices could post their ideas and \nfeelings at any time in the exhibition, with a Wi-Fi connection \nprovided by the museum. This mobile site is custom built for the \nexhibition “Teenie Harris, Photographer: An American Story” at \nthe Carnegie Museum of Art. It provides a friendly and intuitive \nnavigation structure to assist users to visit the exhibition (see \nFigure 1). Visitors can navigate the mobile system by four \ncategories including “HOT!”,”Theme”, “Date”, and “Ex. No”. \nThe “HOT!” category could lead visitors to the most popular \nitems that are getting the most feedback in the gallery. In \naddition, visitors can search for a specific item by entering the \nexhibition number displayed under each of the photographs on \nview. Four types of interactive  feedback are provided: “like”, \n“comment”, “tag”, and feedbacks on Twitter and Facebook. This \nfunctionality is available for every item displayed in the gallery.\n\n\n== Publications ==

This system utilizes human psychology to conform to opinions of friends. When people go to a music concert or exhibition, they commonly ask their friends' opinions, and invite them to go along. Centered on this trusted human network, users can recommend items to their friends and rate their friends' taste about a certain genre of cultural events. This system is to cope with various problems of traditional collaborative filtering technique such as ad-hoc user problem (users copying other users' profile), data sparsity, black-sheep users and system scalability.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n[[Image:Pittcult.gif]]\n\n<br/>\n* For more information, please visit [http://eventur.sis.pitt.edu/help.jsp here] or contact [[User:suleehs | Danielle Lee]]\n\n* [[Publications#Eventur|Publications]] related with Eventur

0	JavaGuide	== Overview ==\nJavaGuide is a personalized front-end for [[QuizJET]] developed by PAWS Lab (Hsiao, 2010). Java Guide collects student performance data sent by QuizJET to the activity storage, determines student current level of knowledge for multiple topics and concepts of Java programming language, and use it to provide adaptive guidance to the questions  that are most appropriate for a specific student given the course goals and current state of knowledge. The navigation support is provided on the level of topics using “Target/Arrows” visual cues where the color of target icon associated with each topic indicates the current importance of the topic and the number of arrows in the target shows the current student knowledge level of the correspondent topics. Several classroom studies of QuizJET demonstrated that the user of personalized front-end significantly increases student performance and nearly doubles course engagement.\n\n== Screenshot ==\n[[Image:JavaGuide.png|JavaGuide]]\n\n== Publications ==\nHsiao, I.-H., Sosnovsky, S., and Brusilovsky, P.

0	ADL	== Description ==\nPAWS participation in ADL is focused in the development of MasteryGrids system. Mastery Grids is a visual-rich, interactive, adaptive E-learning platform with integrated functionalities enabling multi-facet social comparison, open user modeling, and multi-type learning materials support. It presents and compares user learning progress and knowledge level (mastery) by colored grids, tracks user activities and feedbacks dynamically and provides flexible user-centered navigation across different content levels (e.g. topic, question) and different content types (e.g. question, example) of learning materials.\nThe architecture supporting Mastery Grids fulfills a major objective, portability, which is the ability to be integrated to other systems with little set up and modification. The architecture is modular and includes different software components:\n\n*frontend user-system interaction interface, the [[Mastery Grids Interface]],\n\n*backend '''''Aggregate''''' services communicating between the main interface and user modeling services,\n\n*backend user modeling services, and\n\n*backend content providing applications.\n\nAn overall architecture of the system can be sen in the next figure. \n\n[[Image:architecture_v1.png]]\n\n== Systems ==\n\n=== Mastery Grids ===\n[[MasteryGrids|More]]\n\n=== Aggregate ===\n[[Aggregate|More]]\n\n== Learning Content ==\n\n== Authoring Tools == \n==== Content Authoring ====\nThis tool provides the interface for teachers to create and index annotated examples.

0	Aggregate	[[Image:arch_v2.png|Aggregate Architecture]]\n\nWe developed an adaptive social learning architecture Aggregate to support [[Mastery Grids Interface]]. We design this architecture to integrate content from diverse sources. The explanation of the procedures and links to associated resources are given below.\n\n* [[Mastery Grids Interface]] receives all the information to display (this is course structure, links to content and progress levels of the learner and the group of learners) from services hosted in Aggregate (a in the diagram). This information is passed in JSON format. \n\n* To let Mastery Grids know the level of progress of the learners in the topics and the content, Aggregates call services from a User Model (UM in the figure). See point b) in the figure. These services are documented in [https://github.com/PAWSLabUniversityOfPittsburgh/mastery-grids/blob/master/documentation/User_State_protocol.pdf User State Protocol]\n\n* The figure shows several different Content apps (QuizJet, QuizPet, Webex, etc.). Each of these applications are integrated in 2 ways:\n** The content application needs to log information of the learner activity within the content to the User Model (letter c in the diagram). Currently, the content applications are using our ADAPT2 [[CUMULATE protocol]].\n** The content application provides a service to list all the available content. This service implement the [https://github.com/PAWSLabUniversityOfPittsburgh/mastery-grids/blob/master/documentation/Content_Brokering_API_2016_01_21.pdf content brokering specification], which defines a JSON-format protocol to allow external applications to discover content.

0	Mastery_Grids_Interface	Mastery Grids is an [[open social learner modeling]] interface written in Javascript. The interface shows the student's progress or knowledge in topics or content types comparing with other learners, and provides navigation support to access suitable educational content. <!--  [[Image:mg_1.png]] -->\n\n== Open Social Learner Model ==\nMastery Grids is a personalized educational system built to support practice with multiple types of smart learning content. Mastery Grids interface offers topic-based open learner modeling, which integrates features explored on our past successful systems (e.g., [[InterBook]], [[QuizGuide]], [[NavEx]], [[QuizMap]], [[Progressor]]). Combining open learner model with social comparison, i.e., open social learner model, Mastery Grids makes students aware of the strength and weakness of their own knowledge on the system topics and allows them to compare their knowledge with the knowledge of their peers. Our open social learner model encourages students to catch up with other students (observing average class progress or advanced students’ progress) and follow the potential good learning path of their peers.\n\n== Knowledge and Progress Visualization ==\nMastery Grids presents and compares user learning progress and knowledge level (mastery) by colored grids from four perspectives as shown in the following figure. The four perspectives show the current student’s progress (“Me” or my progress), a comparison of performance of current student versus other student in the group (“Me vs group” or comparison grid), performance of the students in the group (“Group” or group grid), and performance of all of the students in the class. \n\n[[Image:MG1.jpg|800px]]\n\n== Social Comparison ==\nSocial comparison is implemented in two ways: 1) Me vs group, which compares an individual learner’s progress or knowledge level with the entire group of students, and 2) Me vs other students, which compares an an individual learner’s progress or knowledge level with each of other students.  Such comparisons can be further conducted by resource types (learning materials) as shown in following figure. \n\n[[Image:MG2.jpg|800px]]\n\n== Adaptive Navigation Support ==\nMastery Grids also provides adaptive navigation support for learning materials (as shown in following figure with stars indicating the recommendations). It tracks user activities and updates student knowledge level in a centralized user modeling server, and thus can report in both progress level (based on activities) and knowledge level (based on estimated user knowledge). It provides flexible user-centered navigation across different content levels (e.g. topic, each content type) and different content types (e.g. problem, animated example) and tracks user feedbacks on recommendations dynamically. Details of user modeling can be found [http://adapt2.sis.pitt.edu/wiki/Adaptive_Navigation_Support_and_Open_Social_Learner_Modeling_for_PAL#Learner_Model here].

0	Adaptive_Navigation_Support_and_Open_Social_Learner_Modeling_for_PAL	== Overview ==\n\nThe goal of this project is to leverage the power of [[open social learner modeling]] and [[adaptive navigation support]] in the context of the envisioned Personalized Assistant for Learning (PAL). The project is supported by the [http://adlnet.gov  Advanced Distributed Learning Initiative] contract W911QY13C0032. This is a joint project with [http://cs.aalto.fi/en/research/ Learning + Technology] research group at Aalto University. The LeTech group at Aalto University focuses on developing several kinds of [http://acos.cs.hut.fi/ smart learning content for Java and Python programming] that are compatible with the project architecture [[Aggregate]].\n\nThe project focuses on both exploration and implementation of adaptive navigation support and open social learner modeling and pursues three directions of work:\n\n* Exploring open social learner modeling interface for diverse learning content\n* Enhancing algorithms for personalized guidance using knowledge-based and social approaches \n* Developing architectural solutions and authoring tools to support open social learner modeling\n\nWe have prepared fliers for quickly getting to know our systems:\n* For researchers or system developers (designers), please check [[Media:MGFlier.pdf|here]].\n* For teachers or educators, please check the flier for your interested domain: [[Media:MasteryGridsFlierJava.pdf|Java]], [[Media:MasteryGridsFlierPythonNew.pdf|Python]], or [[Media:MasteryGridsFlierSQL.pdf|SQL]].\n\n== Open Social Learner Model Interface: Mastery Grids ==\n\n{|\n|valign="top" | [[Image:Mg_1.png|thumb|left|'''100'''|Mastery Grids Interface]]\n|valign="top" | [[Mastery Grids Interface|Mastery Grids]] is a flexible portal to access multiple types of learning content through a personalized interface based on Open Social Learner Modeling (OSLM) [[Mastery Grids Interface]]. It offers a multi-facet social comparison, open learner modeling, and adaptive navigation support to help students  access multiple kinds of smart learning content. With Mastery Grids, instructors could re-use one of the existing installations (see below) or create their own installations by organizing their courses info a sequence of topics and selecting most relevant smart content items of multiple types for each topic. There is a drag-and-drop authoring system to support instructors in creating their own courses.\n\nMastery Grids is based on communication-based personalization infrastructure ADAPT2 (formerly Knowledge Tree) and supported by adaptive social learning framework [[Aggregate]]. ADAPT2 supports smart content invocation with single sign-on, extensive data collection, and student modeling. Aggregate adds several kinds of open student modeling, social comparison, and recommendation. In detail, Mastery Grids presents and compares user learning progress and knowledge level using colored grids, tracks user activities with learning content, and provides flexible user-centered navigation across different content levels (e.g. topic, question) and different content types (e.g. problem, example)\n\n* [[Mastery Grids Interface|More about Mastery Grids interface]]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76YLR2VY2QE YouTube demo of  Mastery Grids interface]\n* [http://adapt2.sis.pitt.edu/um-vis-adl/index.html?usr=adl01&grp=ADL&sid=test&cid=13&data-top-n-grp=5&def-val-rep-lvl-id=p&def-val-res-id=AVG&ui-tbar-rep-lvl-vis=0&ui-tbar-topic-size-vis=0 An interactive demo of Mastery Grids interface]\n|}\n\n== Architecture: Aggregate==\n{|\n|valign="top" | [[Image:arch_v2.png|thumb|left|'''100'''|Aggregate Architecture]]\n|valign="top" | We developed an adaptive social learning architecture [[Aggregate]] to support Mastery Grids interface. [[Aggregate]] is an extension of our original [[ADAPT2]] architecture. On the top of  [[ADAPT2]] , [[Aggregate]] architecture supports several kinds of open student modeling, social comparison, content brokering, and recommendation services. The architecture fulfills a major objective, portability, which is the ability to be integrated to other systems with little set up and modification. The architecture is modular and includes different software components. \n\n* [[ADAPT2| More about ADAPT2]]\n* [[Aggregate| More about Aggregate]]\n|}\n\n== Learner Modeling ==\n{|\n|valign="top" | [[Image:CUMULATE.evidence propagation.png|thumb|left|'''100'''|CUMULATE]]\n|valign="center" | We have developed [[CUMULATE]], a centralized user modeling server built for the [[ADAPT2]] architecture, to provide user modeling support for adaptive educational hypermedia (AEH) systems. CUMULATE allows flexible learner models to infer learner knowledge. Mastery Grids's architecture is supported by CUMULATE and thus it also supports flexible learner models. The explanation of the communication between the interface and learner model can be found in [[Aggregate]]. We have proposed and implemented different learner models over past years, including [[CUMULATE asymptotic knowledge assessment|asymptotic assessment of user knowledge]] which is the main one currently deployed in our systems, and [[Feature-Aware Student knowledge Tracing (FAST)|Feature-Aware Student knowledge Tracing (FAST)]] which is our new learner model proposed in 2014 with state-of-the-art predictive performance. We have also explored different aspects to improve learner modeling, including reducing the content model, better evaluation for practitioners and applying network (graph) analysis.\n\n* [[Learner Modeling|More about Learner Modeling]]\n* [[CUMULATE|More about CUMULATE]]\n* [[CUMULATE asymptotic knowledge assessment|More about asymptotic assessment of user knowledge]]\n* [[Feature-Aware Student knowledge Tracing (FAST)|More about Feature-Aware Student knowledge Tracing (FAST)]]\n|}\n\n== Recommendation ==\n{|\n|valign="top" | [[Image:starRecommendation.png|thumb|left|'''100'''|Personalization]]\n|valign="top" | There are multiple personalization approaches, that are developed and researched in our system. In the form of recommendations, we have various methods in different levels for recommending learning material to students. Two major approached for recommending resources are reactive and proactive recommendations. In the reactive approach, the recommender system activates in reaction to the student's activity, e.g. if the student fails in solving a quiz, the reactive recommender system recommends related examples to this student to help her understand the skills required to solve that quiz. The pro-active recommender system, proactively suggests learning materials to the students. [[Learning Recommendation|==> more]]\n\n\n|}\n\n== Educational Data Mining ==\n{|\n|valign="top" | [[Image:TensorFactorization.png|thumb|left|'''100'''|Educational Data Mining]]\n|valign="top" | In this part of the project, we aim to make sense of data from Mastery Grids system, including logs of student attempts. The goal in this part includes understanding students' learning patterns and its relationship with students' behavioral traits, predicting students' performance, modeling student knowledge, and discovering the content model. These tasks eventually help us in providing a better service to both instructors and students.  [[Educational Data Mining|==> more]]\n\n\n|}\n\n== Smart Content ==\n{|\n|valign="top" | [[Image:AnimatedExamples.jpg|thumb|left|'''100'''|Smart Content (Animated Examples)]]\n|valign="top" | Mastery Grids supports and provides multiple types of learning materials. It has been applied in three domains (Java, SQL, and Python) as a supplementary E-learning system for undergraduate and graduate level programming and database classes since 2013. We have developed different content applications (e.g., [[QuizJET]], [[QuizPET]], [[WebEx]]) and authoring tools (e.g., [[Content Authoring Tools]], [[Course Authoring Tool]], [[Group Authoring Tool]]) for accessing and authoring such contents. In each learning domain, courses are organized by topics and different types of learning contents are arranged under each topic. Learning contents contain problems (quizzes), parson problems, annotated examples, and animated examples collected from experienced course teachers, textbooks or domain experts. [[Smart Content|==> more]]\n|}\n\n== Authoring Tools ==\n{|\n|valign="top" |  [[Image:ExampleAuthoringModify.jpg|thumb|left|'''100'''|Annotated Example Content Authoring]]\n|valign="top" | We have developed four major types of authoring tools for the project: 1) Content Authoring Tools for creating different kinds of smart learning content, 2) Course Authoring Tool for creating adaptive courses that use the content, 3) Group Authoring Tool for managing users and groups, as well as 4) the portal to access different authoring tools. \n\n* [[Authoring Tools|More about Authoring Tools]]\n* [[Content Authoring Tools|More about Content Authoring Tools]]\n* [[Course Authoring Tool|More about Course Authoring Tool]]\n* [[Group Authoring Tool|More about Group Authoring Tool]]\n* [[Authoring Tool Portal|More about Authoring Tool Portal]]\n|}\n\n== Open Source  == \nSoftware sources and documentations are in GitHub [https://github.com/PAWSLabUniversityOfPittsburgh PAWSLabUniversityOfPittsburgh organization], and [https://github.com/acos-server/ acos-server organization].\n* The Mastery Grids Interface, back-end Aggregate and documentation can be found [https://github.com/PAWSLabUniversityOfPittsburgh/mastery-grids here]. \n* User model services can be found in [https://github.com/PAWSLabUniversityOfPittsburgh/AggregateUMServices here].\n* QuizJET Interface, Authoring Tool, Content Brokering and documentations can be found [https://github.com/PAWSLabUniversityOfPittsburgh/quizjet here].\n* QuizPET Interface, Authoring Tool, Content Brokering and documentations can be found [https://github.com/PAWSLabUniversityOfPittsburgh/quizpet here].\n* Parson Problem Authoring Tool can be found [https://github.com/acos-server/acos-jsparsons-generator here].\n* Annotated Examples Interface, Authoring Tool, Content Brokering and documentations can be found [https://github.com/PAWSLabUniversityOfPittsburgh/annotated-examples here].\n* Animated Examples Authoring Tool can be found [https://github.com/acos-server/acos-jsvee-transpiler-python here].\n* Videos User Interface, Authoring Tool, Content Brokering and documentations can be found [https://github.com/PAWSLabUniversityOfPittsburgh/educvideos here]\n\n== Publications ==\n* Gonzalez-Brenes, J.

0	Personalized_Social_Systems_for_Local_Communities	== About the project ==\nThe project explored the use of personalization and mobile computing to increase user engagement in location-bound social systems. The project was originally funded by a Research Award from Google to Peter Brusilovsky, however it continued for many years following the original round of funding. In the course of the project we developed, extended, and explored several location-bounded systems such as Comet, Eventur, and CourseAgent. These systems were actively used for many years in local Pittsburgh community. We developed a range of new recommendation technologies for these systems and explored new approaches to increase user engagement, which is the source of knowledge in local communities\n\n== Motivation ==\nSocial computing systems can serve as a tool for revitalizing and strengthening local communities - in particular by supporting online community information commons for enriching and actively disseminating information about local events, activities, and organizations. While existing social linking systems can allow people to follow or meet each other, they tend to do so in decontextualized virtual spaces and as a result are seen by many as a threat to local communities. In contrast, a social information system that provides a community information commons for collecting, organizing and exploring information about local events and organizations, has the potential to increase individuals’ awareness and connection with their community. However, creating an effective community information commons is challenging. \n\nFirst, information about local events, activities and organizations is often fragmented, incomplete, and difficult to find. While existing channels work well for organizations able to devote resources to formal marketing and advertising, a sustainable community information commons must allow a more diverse set of community members to participate in collection and organization information in a decentralized fashion. Social computing technologies and techniques have the potential to provide a platform through which the small efforts of individuals, both within a community and beyond, can be mobilized to increase the quality of information available about local events, activities, and organizations.  However, in spite of their potential, engaging users in social computing systems can be challenging. Users are eager to contribute for their own good (i.e., list an item to sell on Craigslist), but very hesitant to do it for a community good. Local community information systems must pursue different engagement strategies if they are to provide a useful, organized source of information about local events and activities. \n\nAt the same time, any system that is even moderately successful at aggregating information about community events has to be personalized. No one is interested all events and organizations. Even in a small community, the ability to focus in items of interest within a larger information stream is necessary. A viable community information commons must support personalized information access, enabling individuals to increase the likelihood of seeing personally interesting materials and decrease the distraction of irrelevant events. \t\n\nThe goal of this project is to investigate the nature of community information commons and develop social computing technologies and techniques to increase the impact and viability of these critical socio-technical systems.\n\n== Systems ==\n\n* [[Eventur]] (formerly PittCult) [[Eventur|more]]\n* [[CoMeT]] \n* [[CourseAgent]]\n\n== Team == \n\n* '''PI:'''  [[User:Peterb|Peter Brusilovsky]]: \n\n* Rosta Farzan: Leading research on user engagement, the main developer of CourseAgent 2 system\n\n* Brian Butler: Leading research the work on urban communities\n\n* Chirayu Wongchokprasitti: Research on recommendations, main developer of the CoMeT system\n\n* Danielle Lee: Research on recommender approached based on social links, main developer of Eventur system\n\n* [[User:Clau|Claudia Lopez]]: Researcher on incentive-based design and user enagement\n\n== Publications ==\n\n* Brusilovsky, P., Parra, D., Sahebi, S., and Wongchokprasitti, C.

Knowledge to be acquired during weekly reading assignment is critical for students’ course success. Yet, it is not easy for an instructor to assure that the student completed the assigned readings. Reading assignments produce no artifacts to grade. As a result, the students frequently have insufficient motivation to complete the reading assignments.  This project explores an alternative approach to encourage student reading using a social progress visualization interface [[ReadingCircle]].\n* student online reading process is tracked on the level of individual sections\n* student reading progress is visualized on several levels – from chapters to sections to subsections – and presented to the student\n* students are offered an interface to compare their reading progress with both, the progress of the class as a whole and the progress of individual peers\n\n== Funding ==\nThe project is funded by University of Pittsburgh [http://www.pitt.edu/~facaffs/acie/|Advisory Council on Instructional Excellence] in 2012.\n\n== Systems ==\n\n* [[ReadingCircle]]\n\n== Keywords ==\n\n[[ReadingCircle]], Social Comparison, [[Open Social Student Modeling]], OSSM, [[Social Navigation]], Online Reading, Electronic Textbook\n\n== More information ==\n\n* Watch [http://www.pitt.edu/~facaffs/acie/brusilovsky.html| project video]\n* Read [http://www.teachingkb.cidde.pitt.edu/teaching-times/school-of-information-sciences-encourages-online-reading-through-social-progress-visualization/| Teaching Times article]\n\n== Contacts ==\n[[User:julio | Julio Guerra]]\n\n[[User:Dparra | Denis Parra (past developer)]]\n\n== Publications == \n\nGuerra, J., Parra, D., and Brusilovsky, P.

0	Supporting_Learning_from_Examples_in_a_Programming_Course	== Project Summary == \nIt has often been claimed that humans use solutions to previous problems to solve new problems or planning tasks. Especially in the domain of programming, both experienced and novice programmers often use program examples to learn the semantics and pragmatics of programming languages and to solve programming problems. To support this need, this projects focused on developing a rich Web-based database of programming examples that students can explore at their own pace. In the course of this project, we developed [[WebEx]], a Web-based tool for exploring interactive programming examples and [[NavEx]], an adaptive navigation support service the guides students to most appropriate examples.\n\n== Funding ==\n\nThe project is funded by University of Pittsburgh [http://www.pitt.edu/~facaffs/acie/ | Advisory Council on Instructional Excellence] in 2001.\n\n== Keywords ==\n\nExamples, Adaptive Navigation Support, Worked-out Examples\n\n== Systems ==\n\n* [[WebEx]]\n* [[NavEx]]\n\n== More information ==\n\n* Read [http://www.teachingkb.cidde.pitt.edu/teaching-times/supporting-learning-from-examples-in-a-programming-course/| Teaching Times article]\n\n== Contacts ==\n[[User:Myudelson | Michael V.

0	Personalized_Learning_Systems	Personalized Learning Systems is one of the core topics of our lab. Personalized learning technologies provide an alternative to the dominant “one-size-fits-all” approach to treating diverse student audiences. While having a relatively long history, this research direction moved to the forefront only recently when modern information technologies opened new learning opportunities for a wide range of students. Nowadays, personalized learning is considered to be a top priority research direction by many experts. For example, [http://www.engineeringchallenges.org/cms/8996/9127.aspx advanced personalized learning] was named among [http://www.engineeringchallenges.org/ 14 Grand Challenges for Engineering] along with preventing nuclear terror and making solar energy economical. It has also been listed among the highest funding priorities in [http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2010/2/69358-assessing-the-changing-us-it-rd-ecosystem/fulltext Communications of the ACM].\n\nPersonalized learning technologies enable e-learning systems to maintain a model of the goals, preferences and knowledge of each student and apply this model to adapt the system performance to the student making the learning process more efficient and enjoyable. In so doing, various kinds of personalized e-learning systems demonstrated their ability to help students acquire knowledge faster, improve learning outcomes, reduce navigational overhead, and increase student engagement. Our team is interested a range of personalized learning technologies, focusing on modeling learner knowledge of the subject. Individual models of learner knowledge that our systems maintain are used to guide learners to the most appropriate learning content using course sequencing and adaptive navigation support technologies. Some systems also use the models to deliver adaptive visualization. Below is the list of personalized learning systems developed by the members of our group. Most of these systems are open for anyone to use and explore online.\n\nSystems:\n* [[QuizGuide]]\n* [[NavEx]]\n* [[Database Exploratorium]]\n* [[InterBook]]\n* [[KnowledgeZoom]]\n* [[MasteryGrids]]\n* [[JavaGuide]]\n* [[Progressor]]\n* [[ProgressorPlus]]
0	Adaptive_Electronic_Textbooks	Adaptive Electronic Textbooks were a topic of interests of [[our lab| Home]] members for many years. While the majority of works on electronic books is concerned with just coping the old format in the new media, we believe that moving textbooks to electronic form brings a number of interesting opportunities that go well beyond the functionality of traditional printed textbooks. In our work we primarily explored the opportunities to make an electronic book adaptive (i.e., personalized), interactive, and social.

0	Personalized_Access_to_Open_Corpus_Educational_Resources_through_Adaptive_Navigation_Support_and_Adaptive_Visualization	== Summary ==\nA variety of educational resources such as tutorials, electronic textbooks, and subject overviews are now available on the Web for almost every subject. Finding high quality educational resources is much less of a problem with modern Web search engines and DL search services. However, the resources that one finds have different presentation styles, target audiences, and coverage; many resources are highly redundant. The abundance of resources has created another problem: How to help students find, organize, and use resources that match their individual goals, interests, and current knowledge. In brief, access is not the issue; personalized access is.\nIn the context of this project we are developing a new generation of techniques for personalized access to open corpus educational resources. Our main foci are adaptive navigation support and adaptive visualization - the least investigated areas on the map of personalized information access research. These technologies support a higher level of interactivity and expressive power than what is now offered by modern adaptive information retrieval and filtering systems and take into account not just the interests, but also the current knowledge and goals of their users.\nIn a range of smaller-scale projects and systems listed below we are exploring and developing techniques that can provide adaptive navigation support for browsing-based access to open corpus resources and support information access through adaptive information visualization. The systems and tools we are developing are open for the educational use in other universities. We are also interested in collaborating with teams who share our goals and interests.\n\n==Funding ==\n[[Image:Nsf.gif|thumb|left]]\nProject is Funded by  National Science Foundation (Information & Intelligent Systems (IIS) ) through CAREER Award #0447083.\n\nAny opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation.\n\n== Systems ==\n* [[AnnotatEd]]\n* [[Knowledge Sea II]]\n* [[NavEx]]\n* [[ADVisE]]\n*[[QuizGuide]]

0	Smart_Content	Mastery Grids supports and provides multiple types of learning materials. It has been applied in three domains (Java, SQL, and Python) as a supplementary E-learning system for undergraduate and graduate level programming and database classes since 2013. In each learning domain, courses are organized by topics and different types of learning contents are arranged under each topic. Learning contents contain semantics, problems, parson problems, annotated examples, and animated examples. This sections reviews all these content types.\n\nWhile Mastery Grids interface can support any kind of content, we try to focus on "smart learning content" that interactively engages student, collects interaction data, and provides various kinds of feedback. For a discussion and definition of smart learning content, see the following ITiCSE Working Group Report:\n\nBrusilovsky, P., Edwards, S., Kumar, A., Malmi, L., Benotti, L., Buck, D., Ihantola, P., Prince, R., Sirkiä, T., Sosnovsky, S., Urquiza, J., Vihavainen, A., and Wollowski, M. (2014) [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273380880_Increasing_Adoption_of_Smart_Learning_Content_for_Computer_Science_Education Increasing Adoption of Smart Learning Content for Computer Science Education]. In: Proceedings of the Working Group Reports of the 2014 on Innovation & Technology in Computer Science Education Conference, Uppsala, Sweden, ACM, pp. 31-57. \n\n\n== Code-Tracing Problems for Java and Python ==\nWe have developed a content application [[QuizJET]] providing problems to learn Java Programming. Here are two problems for Java. The left one shows a problem with a single class asking the value of a variable in a piece of code. The right one shows a problem with multiple classes asking the console output of a piece of code. Correctness is accessed by the content application and students can attempt multiple times with different instantiations of the variables in the problem.  Similarly, we have developed a content application [[QuizPET]] providing the same type of problems to learn Python Programming.\n\nNew problems for [[QuizJET]] and [[QuizPET]] could be easily created with [[QuizJET Authoring System]] tool and [[QuizPET Authoring System]].\n\n[[Image:Problems.jpg|650x1300px]]\n\n== SQL Problems ==\n\nFor learning SQL, we have developed a content application [[SQLKnoT]] providing another type of problem. Students are asked to write a complete query to achieve a task in each problem. Here is a problem for SQL. \n\n[[Image:Problems_Sql.jpg|500x750px]]\n\n== Parson Problems for Python ==\nHere is a parson problems for Python. In such problems, students are asked to drag different fragments of a code to construct a complete code in order to achieve a task. Some examples of created parson problems can be found [http://acos.cs.hut.fi/ here] under "Installed content packages" (e.g. jsparsons-python tab).\n\nNew parson problems can be created by [[Parson Problem Authoring System]].\n\n[[Image:ParsonProblems.jpg|750x1000px]]\n\n== Annotated Examples for Java, Python, and SQL ==\nWe have developed a content application [[WebEx]] providing annotated examples. Students can click on the left side box to learn about each line’s related concepts. We has a large collection of WebEx examples for Java, Python, SQL, C, and other programming languages. New WebEx examples could be created with [[Annotated Example Authoring System]]. \n\nSince 2016, we switched to a more advanced system [[PCEX]] for presenting annotated worked code examples for Python and Java. WebEx is still being used to present SQL code examples. [[PCEX]] has its own authoring system [[WEAT]].\n\nBelow,  you can see an annotated WebEx code examples for Python. It is presented using [[JSWebEx]] is a newer Javascript interface that replaces the old server-side WebEx interface, but using the same large collection of examples developed for WebEx. \n\n[[Image:jswebex.png|650x800px]]\n\n== Animated Examples for Python and Java ==\nWe have created a large number of animated program execution examples for Python, Java, and SQL. In such examples, the line-by-line execution of a piece of code is visualized by animations. \n\nHere is an animated example for Python. More animated examples created for Python can be found [http://acos.cs.hut.fi/ here] under "Installed content packages" (e.g. jsvee-python tab).\n\nNew animated example can be created by [[Animated Example Authoring System]].\n\n[[Image:AnimatedExamples.jpg|750x1000px]]\n\n== Animated Examples for SQL ==\n\nWe developed a collection of animated examples for SQL using Flash. More animated examples created for SQL can be found [http://columbus.exp.sis.pitt.edu/sql_ae_demo/ here]. Unfortunately, these examples can't be executed in modern browsers anymore.\n\n[[Image:AnimatedExamplesSQL.jpg|750x1000px]]\n\n== Videos ==\nWe have created applications for collecting, editing, authoring videos.

0	Feature-Aware_Student_knowledge_Tracing_(FAST)	Feature-Aware Student knowledge Tracing (FAST) is a novel, efficient student model created by PAWs lab and Pearson with the state-of-the-art predictive performance. It allows general, flexible features into [http://liris.cnrs.fr/~pchampin/2014/m2iade-ia2/_static/893CorbettAnderson1995.pdf Knowledge Tracing], which is the most popular student model. For the first time it unifies existed specially designed student models based on Knowledge Tracing framework with integrated advantages. We demonstrate FAST’s flexibility with examples of feature sets that are relevant to a wide audience: we haved uses features in FAST to model (i) multiple subskills, (ii) temporal Item Response Theory, and (iii) expert knowledge. Compared with Knowledge Tracing, (1) it improves up to 25% in classification performance, (2) it generates more interpretable, consistent parameters, and (3) it is 300 times faster. In a [http://adenu.ia.uned.es/workshops/pale2014/pale2014_proceedings_vol1181.pdf#page=9 follow-up study], we compared FAST to the best paper model (a single-purpose model) of the same year with favorable results while FAST is designed as a general-purpose model.

0	Educational_Data_Mining	Mastery Grids aims to provide better experience to both students and instructors by using automatic tools and techniques that are derived by machine learning and data mining algorithms on its data. In this section, we introduce some of the projects performed on Mastery Grids' data for this purpose.\n\n== Problem Solving Genome for Students ==\nIn this research we study the students' behavioral patterns in attempting quizzes and repeating them. We look at attempt sequence of students, model, and examine patterns of student behavior with parameterized exercises. Starting with micro-patterns (genes) that describe small chunks of repetitive behavior of students, we construct individual student profiles (genomes) as frequency profiles. These profiles show the dominance of each gene (repetitive pattern) in individual behavior. We cluster the students using these profiles and study their learning gains in relation to their constructed genome. The exploration of student genomes revealed the individual genome is considerably stable, distinguishing students from their peers. It uniquely identifies a user among other users over the whole duration of the course despite a considerable growth of student knowledge over the course duration. While the problem complexity does affect the behavior patterns as well, we demonstrated that the genome is defined by some inherent characteristics of the user rather than a difficulty profile of the problems she solves.\nIn the group level, all students can be most reliably split into just two cohorts that differ considerably by their behavior. After that split, we are able to contrast successful and less successful learners by their behavior and identify “beneficial” and “harmful” genes for each cohort. In particular, it is interesting to observe that the behavior of successful learners in one cohort is somewhat closer to the behavior of the opposite cohort.\n\n\nCategories\n[[Image:ProblemSolvingGenome.png|650x1300px]]\n\n\n== Tensor and Matrix Factorization in Predicting Student Performance ==\nThis research aims to predict success and failure of students in future questions using collaborative-filtering approaches including tensor and matrix factorizations. One of the benefits of these models is their ability to estimate the underlying skills of questions automatically. In this work, we research on these approaches on educational data in two settings: considering the attempt (time) sequence of students and considering the underlying concept structure of questions. We compare these approaches with state of the art methods such as [[Feature-Aware Student knowledge Tracing (FAST)|Feature-Aware Student knowledge Tracing (FAST)]], Bayesian Knowledge Tracing, and Performance Factor Analysis.\n\n== Feedback-Driven Tensor Factorization or Simultaneously Modeling Student Knowledge and Course Content ==\nAlthough the tasks of domain modeling, predicting student performance, and student knowledge modeling are interrelated, these problems are usually addressed separately in the literature of educational data mining. Also, the traditional tensor and matrix factorization algorithms, that can extract the domain model while predicting student performance, are not designed for educational purposes: these models ignore the fact that students' knowledge in each step is related to her knowledge in previous steps and the concepts she is practicing while taking current learning resources. In this work, we propose a tensor factorization algorithm that can simultaneously perform all of the aforementioned tasks, while imposing a constraint to increase the knowledge of students using the feedback it receives from the current learning resources.\n\n[[Image:TensorFactorization.png|650x1300px]]\n\n== Exploring Problem Solving Paths in a Java Programming Course ==\nAssessment of students’ programming submissions has been the focus of interest in many studies. Although the final submissions capture the whole program, they often tell very little about how it was\ndeveloped. In this paper, we are able to look at intermediate programming steps using a unique dataset that captures a series of snapshots showing how students developed their program over time. We assessed each of these intermediate steps and performed a fine-grained concept-based analysis on each step to identify the most common programming paths. Analysis of results showed that most of the students tend to incrementally build the program and improve its correctness. This finding provides us with evidence that intermediate programming steps are important, and need to be taken into account for not only improving user modelling in educational programming systems, but also for providing better feedback to students. \n\n[[Image:Programming_patterns.jpg|900x500px]]\n\n== Publications ==\n* Guerra, J., Sahebi, S., Lin, Y.-R., and Brusilovsky, P.

Using the current level of knowledge for concepts associated with each line, we can calculate how much knowledge associated with each line is already known to the learner. We expected that visualizing this dynamically (i.e., displaying the amount of knowledge as a visual cue next to the line) could help users to select most important lines.

It collects evidence (events) about student learning from multiple servers that interact with the student. It stores students' activities and infers their learning characteristics, which are the basis for an individual adaptation to them. ... External and internal inference agents process the flow of events and update the values in the inference model of the server. Each inference agent is responsible for maintaining a specific property in the inference model, such as the current motivation level of the student or the student's current level of knowledge for each course topic.

Compared with Knowledge Tracing, (1) it improves up to 25% in classification performance, (2) it generates more interpretable, consistent parameters, and (3) it is 300 times faster.

This data can potentially be used to model student knowledge acquisition. However, reading activity is often overlooked in canonical student modeling. Prior studies modeling learning from reading either estimate student knowledge at the end of all reading activities, or use quiz performance data with expert-crafted knowledge components (KCs). In this work, we demonstrate that the dynamic modeling of student knowledge is feasible and that automatic text analysis can be applied to save expert effort. We propose a data-driven approach for dynamic student modeling in textbook-based learning. We formulate the problem of modeling learning from reading as a reading- time prediction problem, reconstruct existing popular student models (such as Knowledge Tracing) and explore two automatic text analysis approaches (bag-of-words-based and latent semantic-based) to build the KC model. We evaluate the proposed framework using a dataset collected from a Human-Computer Interaction course. Results show that our approach for reading modeling is plausible; the pro- posed Knowledge Tracing-based student model reliably outperforms baselines and the latent semantic-based approach can be a promising way to construct a KC model. Serving as the first step to model dynamic knowledge in textbook- based learning, our framework can be applied to a broader context of open-corpus personalized learning.

We also explored challenges of using observational data to answer research question such as determine the importance of example usage.\n\n=== Polygon framework ===\nLatent variable models, such as the popular Knowledge Tracing method, are often used to enable adaptive tutoring systems to personalize education. However, finding optimal model parameters is usually a difficult non-convex optimization problem when considering latent variable models. Prior work has reported that latent variable models obtained from educational data vary in their predictive performance, plausibility, and consistency. Unfortunately, there are still no unified quantitative measurements of these properties. This paper suggests a general unified framework (that we call Polygon) for multifaceted evaluation of student models. The framework takes all three dimensions mentioned above into consideration and offers novel metrics for the quantitative comparison of different student models. These properties affect the effectiveness of the tutoring experience in a way that traditional predictive performance metrics fall short. The present work demonstrates our methodology of comparing Knowledge Tracing with a recent model called [[Feature-Aware Student knowledge Tracing (FAST)]] on datasets from different tutoring systems. Our analysis suggests that FAST generally improves on Knowledge Tracing along all dimensions studied.\n\n[[Image:Polygon.jpg|800x1600px]]\n\n=== Learner Effort-Outcomes Paradigm (Leopard) ===\nClassification evaluation metrics are often used to evaluate adaptive tutoring systems— programs that teach and adapt to humans. Unfortunately, it is not clear how intuitive these metrics are for practitioners with little machine learning background. Moreover, our experiments suggest that existing convention for evaluating tutoring systems may lead to suboptimal decisions. We propose the Learner Effort-Outcomes Paradigm (Leopard), a new framework to evaluate adaptive tutoring. We introduce Teal and White, novel automatic metrics that apply Leopard and quantify the amount of effort required to achieve a learning outcome. Our experiments suggest that our metrics are a better alternative for evaluating adaptive tutoring.\n\n[[Image:Leopard.png|500x300px]]\n\n=== Publications ===\n* Huang, Y., González-Brenes, J.

In such cases, it is not clear how the evidence of student performance translates to individual skills. As a result, traditional approaches to knowledge modeling, such as Knowledge Tracing (KT), which traces students’ knowledge of each decomposed individual skill, might fall short. We argue that skill combinations might carry extra specific knowledge, and mastery should be asserted only when a student can fluently apply skills in combination with other skills in different contexts. We propose a data-driven framework to model skill combination patterns for tracing students’ deeper knowledge. We automatically identify significant skill combinations from data and construct a conjunctive knowledge model with a hierarchical skill representation based on a Bayesian Network. We also propose a novel evaluation framework primarily focuses on the knowledge inference quality, since we argue that traditional prediction metrics no longer suffice to differentiate between shallow and deep knowledge modeling. Our experiments on datasets collected from two programming learning systems show that proposed model significantly increases mastery inference accuracy and tends to more reasonably distribute students’ efforts comparing with traditional KT models and its nonhierarchical counterparts. Our work serves as a first step towards building skill application context sensitive model for modeling students’ deep, robust learning.\n\n=== Publications ===\n* Huang, Y., Guerra-Hollstein, J., and Brusilovsky, P.

([http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1618/PALE4.pdf paper])\n\n== Content Model Reduction for Better Learner Models ==\n=== Introduction ===\nWhen modeling student knowledge and predicting student performance, adaptive educational systems frequently rely on content models that connect learning content (i.e., problems) with its underlying domain knowledge (i.e., knowledge components, KCs) required to complete it. In some domains, such as programming, the number of KCs associated with advanced learning contents is quite large. It complicates modeling due to increasing noise and decreases efficiency. We argue that the efficiency of modeling and prediction in such domains could be improved without the loss of quality by reducing problems content models to a subset of most important KCs. To prove this hypothesis, we evaluate several KC reduction methods varying reduction size by assessing the prediction performance of Knowledge Tracing and Performance Factor Analysis. The results show that the predictive performance using reduced content models can be significantly better than using original one, with extra benefits of reducing time and space.\n\n=== Publications ===\n* Huang, Y., Xu, Y., and Brusilovsky, P.

The key idea of this approach is that programming concepts are truly learned not in isolation, but rather in combination with other concepts. Following this idea, we represent a student model as a graph where links are gradually added when the student's ability to work with connected pairs of concepts in the same context is confirmed. We also hypothesize that with this graph-based approach a number of traditional graph metrics could be used to better measure student knowledge than using more traditional scalar models of student knowledge. To collect some early evidence in favor of this idea, we used data from several classroom studies to correlate graph metrics with various performance and motivation metrics.\n\n=== Publications ===\n* Guerra, J., Huang, Y., Hosseini, R., & Brusilovsky, P.

0	Open_Corpus_Personalized_Learning	Goal: This project challenges the assumption that adaptive hypermedia systems require expensive knowledge engineering for domain and content modeling. It replaces carefully-crafted domain model with automatically-created domain models, lowering the cost of developing adaptive educational hypermedia software while also providing a wider range of instructional paths through the content. Adaptive educational hypermedia is known for its ability to improve learning outcomes and engagement maximizing educational opportunity for learners with different levels of knowledge. The development of this more automatic, open-corpus approach to adaptive educational hypermedia will increase the volume and the variety of resources available for meaningful online learning, especially for individuals learning on their own. Automatic knowledge indexing of educational content makes the system easy to maintain and update over time. These new open corpus user modeling techniques automatically adapt user models and personalized guidance to new materials as they are acquired. The ability to automatically organize, index, and adaptively recommend distributed educational content without the need of manual processing by system developers, enables new material to be integrated dynamically and with minimal effort in response to student needs.\n\nThis project merges research on text analysis, human learning, and personalization to enable open corpus personalized learning. It develops its models of the domain and human learning from an initial set of well-organized, manually selected materials. Automatic text analysis creates an ensemble of domain models with different characteristics. Each individual model may be flawed or incomplete, however, collectively they provide comprehensive coverage of the topic from several perspectives, thus reducing the manual effort required to create adaptive educational hypermedia. Multiple perspectives also give the system more flexibility in how to guide each student. These domain models are used as a foundation for building and maintaining dynamic models of user knowledge. The ensemble of domain and user models is used to deliver reactive and proactive adaptive guidance in an open corpus context. The growth of a person's knowledge is inferred by observing learner behavior and obtaining occasional feedback. This exploratory research opens the way to open corpus personalized learning. The domain modeling, user modeling, and personalization techniques developed in this research will be evaluated using a multi-layer framework that includes assessment by subject experts, performance prediction, cross-validation, and user studies.\n\n==The Project Team==\n<gallery>\nImage:Peter.jpg|'''[[User:Peterb | Peter Brusilovsky]]'''<br/>Director\nImage:Daqing_He.png|'''[http://www.pitt.edu/~dah44/ Daqing He]'''<br/>Co-director\nImage:Yun_Acadamic.png|[http://columbus.exp.sis.pitt.edu/yunhuang/index.htm Yun Huang]\nImage:shuguang.png|[http://www.pitt.edu/~shh69/ Shuguang Han]\nImage:rui.png|[http://memray.me/ Rui Meng]\nImage:Sanqiang.png|[http://pitt.edu/~sanqiang Sanqiang Zhao]\nImage:Jordan.jpeg|[http://pitt.edu/~jab464 Jordan Barria-Pineda]\nImage:Avatar.jpg|[http://pitt.edu/~hkc6 Hung Chau]\nImage:k.thaker.png|[http://kthaker.com Khushboo Thaker]\n\n</gallery>\n\n==Education Content Linking==\n{|\n|valign="top" | [[ Image:Content-linking.png|thumb|left|'''100'''|Concepts Backbone connecting Educational Systems]]\n|valign="center" |\nDigitization has brought a significant change to the educational sector in the past ten years, making digital textbooks a convenient and popular resource for learning. Starting as merely a digital copy of paper textbooks, digital textbooks gradually integrated a number of innovative and advanced functionality. Rapid digitization also remarkably increased the volume of open learning resources, which have grown very popular, providing learners with great opportunities to expand their learning. Moreover, these new digital learning resources could be combined with the traditional learning process. For example, a learner may come across the concept of ``Indexing'' while reading a textbook on ``Information Retrieval''. This triggers her to engage extra online materials on ``Indexing'' to learn the state-of-the-art practical methods or research trends. \n\nThe goal of the project is to address this challenge by providing links to related content at different textbook materials. In this project, we would like to use concepts as a backbone for connecting different education materials. This is a challenging task since textbooks and online materials are written by different authors, for different audiences, and frequently use different terms/words to express the same concepts. Furthermore, many domains lack formal domain models or ontologies, where all domain concepts are listed and organized. Therefore, the association of terms and concepts, and the representation of concepts should be automatically discovered and constructed.\n\nTo address these challenges, our work applies distributed neural representations, which demonstrated an ability to solve the term-mismatch problem by transferring the representation of terms to an N-dimension continuous vector (also called embedding). The expectation is that terms or words which share the same semantic meaning will be nearer in this N-dimensional continuous vector space. \n|}\n\n\n==Knowledge Extraction==\n{|\n|valign="top" | [[ Image:Knowledge-linking-Illustration.png|thumb|left|'''100'''|Dynamic Linking Textbooks]]\n|valign="center" |\nThe Internet has dramatically increased both the volume and variety of online educational resources, such as online textbooks, online courses, and tutorials. The development of modern search techniques has further promoted the quick access of these resources. However, most of these educational resources are not well-structured, which imposed an important challenge -- readers without sufficient background knowledge may be difficult to understand its content. To achieve the goal of recommending ''the right content'' that matches individuals' knowledge levels, the first critical step is to provide a better organization for educational resources. The project visions two important components when organizing educational resources: (1) knowledge concept extraction; and (2) concept hierarchy extraction. Traditional solutions for these two problems heavily rely on experts' manual efforts which are time-consuming and unscalable. \n\nOur goal for knowledge extraction is to provide a scalable solution for the above two problems. We pilot our study with extracting knowledge structures from textbooks since they provide a comprehensive list of concepts and are often used as major educational resources in schools, colleges and universities. In addition, textbooks are also equipped with structural information such as table of contents and glossaries, which are very helpful in identifying concepts and their relationships. \n\n\nHowever, the automated extraction of knowledge concepts. Accurately extracting knowledge concepts from educational content is a challenge since the miss of a large-scale knowledge concept labels for building reliable machine learning algorithms. Considering the high time cost for expert-based labeling, we explore an alternative crowdsourcing-based, with restricted quality control, approach. That is, we distribute our knowledge concept labeling work to massive crowdsourcing workers, and further aggregate the obtained labels based on well-developed quality control methods in crowdsourcing. So far, we have built our annotation system and conducted several pilot studies. In the future, we would like to conduct a live experiment to examine the validity of this approach.\n|}\n\n== Learner Modeling ==\n{|\n|valign="top" | [[Image:ReadingLearningProcess.png|thumb|left|'''100'''|Dynamic Knowledge Modeling in Textbook Reading]]\n|valign="center" | We have recently proposed a data-driven framework for [[Dynamic Knowledge Modeling in Textbook-Based Learning| dynamic knowledge modeling in textbook-based learning]] (UMAP 2016). We formulated the problem of modeling learning from reading as a reading-time prediction problem, reconstructed existing popular student models (such as Knowledge Tracing) and explored two automatic text analysis approaches (bag-of-words-based and latent semantic-based) to build the KC model. This framework can be applied to a broader context of open-corpus personalized learning, empowering learners with the ability to access the right reading content at the right moment, despite the huge volume of online educational content. We are also working on applying [[Feature-Aware Student knowledge Tracing (FAST)|Feature-Aware Student knowledge Tracing (FAST)]] which is our new learner model proposed in 2014 with state-of-the-art predictive performance into textbook-based learning environment. \n\nOver past years, our lab has developed [[CUMULATE]], a centralized user modeling server built for the [[ADAPT2]] architecture, to provide user modeling support for adaptive educational hypermedia (AEH) systems. We have proposed and implemented different learner models , including [[CUMULATE asymptotic knowledge assessment|asymptotic assessment of user knowledge]]. We have explored different aspects to improve learner modeling, including reducing the content model, better evaluation for practitioners and applying network (graph) analysis.\n\n* [[Dynamic Knowledge Modeling in Textbook-Based Learning|More about dynamic knowledge modeling in textbook-based learning]]\n* [[Learner Modeling|More about learner modeling]]\n* [[Feature-Aware Student knowledge Tracing (FAST)|More about Feature-Aware Student knowledge Tracing (FAST)]]\n* [[CUMULATE|More about CUMULATE]]\n* [[CUMULATE asymptotic knowledge assessment|More about asymptotic assessment of user knowledge]]\n|}\n\n==The Experimental Platform==\n\nIn order to support students' learning in the classroom environment, we have implemented a web platform for students to access class materials including textbooks, research publications, web tutorials, etc. More importantly, the system automatically records users' reading behaviors in order to be able to build their student models based on this data. By now, the reading system is able to render material in two formats:\n* Image-based\n* HTML-based (not tested yet in classroom studies)\nWe plan to support pdf document rendering soon.\n\n[[Image:ReadingSystem_122016.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Current reading platform.|The experimental Reading System.]]\n\nThe reading system is basically formed by 2 main parts:\n* The reader itself (see right side of the figure)\n* The student reading data section (see left side of the figure)\n\nIn the student reading data section, the users can have access to two information sources. The first one is a sunburst hierarchical visualization tool (see upper section) that allows them to know their progress in the reading of the contents that are associated with the course using a color scale encoding from red (non-read) to green (totally read). The former version of this visualization tool is called [[ReadingCircle]]. \nThe second one (see lower section) is the hierarchical index of the group, where each section\nThe system is created for including learning material following a hierarchical structure in a similar way as books are structured (chapter, subchapter, section, etc.). In addition to this, the system allows the inclusion of multiple choice questions at the end of each section with the aim of test the acquired knowledge of the students.\n\n==Publications==\n* Huang, Yun and Yudelson, Michael and Han, Shuguang and He, Daqing and Brusilovsky, Peter.

0	Dynamic_Knowledge_Modeling_in_Textbook-Based_Learning	Various e-learning systems that provide electronic textbooks are gathering data on large numbers of student reading interactions. This data can potentially be used to model student knowledge acquisition. However, reading activity is often overlooked in canonical student modeling. Prior studies modeling learning from reading either estimate student knowledge at the end of all reading activities, or use quiz performance data with expert-crafted knowledge components (KCs). In this work, we demonstrate that the dynamic modeling of student knowledge is feasible and that automatic text analysis can be applied to save expert effort. We propose a data-driven approach for dynamic student modeling in textbook-based learning. We formulate the problem of modeling learning from reading as a reading- time prediction problem, reconstruct existing popular student models (such as Knowledge Tracing) and explore two automatic text analysis approaches (bag-of-words-based and latent semantic-based) to build the KC model. We evaluate the proposed framework using a dataset collected from a Human-Computer Interaction course. Results show that our approach for reading modeling is plausible; the pro- posed Knowledge Tracing-based student model reliably outperforms baselines and the latent semantic-based approach can be a promising way to construct a KC model. \n\nOverall, our work could be considered as the first step to model dynamic knowledge in textbook-based learning. We believe that our framework is promising and that its application lies beyond textbook-based learning. This framework can be applied to a broader context of open-corpus personal- ized learning, empowering learners with the ability to access the right reading content at the right moment, despite the huge volume of online educational content.\n\n\n[[Image:ReadingLearningProcessExplain.png|300x300px]]\n[[Image:TrainExplain.png|450x450px]]\n\n\n\n== Publications ==\n* Huang, Yun, Michael Yudelson, Shuguang Han, Daqing He, and Peter Brusilovsky.

ELM-ART offered a dynamic view, which visualized the current state of learner knowledge about concepts and functions of LISP programming language and allowed learners to correct system's estimation of their knowledge.\n\n[[Image:ELM-ART-OLM.gif|400px|OLM in ELM-ART]]\n\n== Open Learner Modeling in InterBook ==\nPeter\n\n== Open Learner Modeling with Adaptive Navigation Support in QuizGuide and JavaGuide ==\n\nIn our work with [[QuizGuide]] and [[JavaGuide]] systems we attempted to merge the power of open learner models with the power of adaptive navigation support. While traditional OLM focuses on reflecting student knowledge, we wanted to give students an immediate chance to act. For example, observing that knowledge of a specific topic is too low, a student might want to immediately access learning content that could help to bridge the gap.\n\n[[QuizGuide]] is an adaptive front-end to a collection of interactive self-assessment questions in the domain of C programming. The system is able to model learner knowledge independently by topic and visualize the state of this learner model through adaptive link annotation of the “target-arrow” icons. The number of arrows in the target reflects the level of knowledge the student has acquired on the topic: the more arrows the target has, the higher the level of knowledge. The intensity of the target’s color shows the relevance of the topic to the current learning goal: the more intense the color is, the more relevant the topic. This interface combined successful features of open learner models and navigation support: it provides a clear presentation of student knowledge by topic while also helping the student to select the optimal topic to work (one that is ready to be explored, but still not mastered).

Computer Science Education\n(CSE) researchers are increasingly making use of large collections of data generated by the click streams\ncoming from eTextbooks, interactive programming environments, and other smart content. However,\nCSE research faces barriers that slow progress: \n\n* Collection of computer science learning process and outcome data generated by one system is not compatible with that from other systems.\n* Computer science problem solving and learning (e.g., open-ended coding solutions to complex problems) is quite different from the type of data (e.g., discrete answers to questions or verbal responses) that current educational data mining focuses on.\n\nThe project goal is to build community and capacity among CSE researchers, data scientists, and\nlearning scientists toward reducing these barriers and facilitating the full potential of data-intensive\nresearch on learning and improving computer science education. We are bringing together CSE tool build\ncommunities with learning science and technology researchers toward a software infrastructure that\nsupports scaled and sustainable data-intensive research in CSE that contributes to basic science of human\nlearning of complex problem solving. This goal is being achieved through a set of community-building and infrastructure\ncapacity-building activities whose ultimate goal is to develop and disseminate infrastructure that facilitates\nthree aspects of CSE research: \n\n* development and broader re-use of innovative learning content that is instrumented for rich data collection, \n* formats and tools for analysis of learner data,\n* best practices to make large collections of learner data and associated analytics available to researchers in CSE, data science, or learning science. \n\n\nWe engage a large community\nof researchers to define, develop, and use critical elements of this infrastructure to address specific\ndata-intensive research questions. We are hosting workshops, meetings, and online forums leveraging\nexisting communities and building new capacities toward significant research outcomes and lasting\ninfrastructure support.\n\nThis is a collaborative project with Carnegie Mellon University and Virginia Tech teams. \n\n== Current State ==\nThis community-building project has now been expanded into a full-scale infrastructure development project [[An Infrastructure for Sustainable Innovation and Research in Computer Science Education]]. All updates will be posted to the [[An Infrastructure for Sustainable Innovation and Research in Computer Science Education|new project page]]. Make sure also to visit [https://cssplice.github.io/ project Web site] where you can find more information about the project as well as various project materials and resources.

To assist in this endeavor, the project 'HELPeR: Health e-Librarian with Personalized Recommender' has been developed. This innovative system aims to empower ovarian cancer patients and caregivers by providing personalized, accessible, and up-to-date information. Recognizing the diverse health literacy levels and specific informational needs of users, HELPeR is designed to streamline the process of finding reliable, relevant, and recent resources. This system could benefit patients in a landscape where patients and caregivers often face overwhelming amounts of data, varying in quality and relevance.\n\nAt the heart of HELPeR's utility is its user-friendly interface, which allows for intuitive navigation and interaction with a vast array of resources. As depicted in Figure 1, the interface features a straightforward layout with a search bar, filtering options, and a carousel display for search results. This design is deliberately chosen to ensure ease of use and familiarity for users of all backgrounds. The system's unique feature is its ability to adapt to the user's health literacy level, highlighted by color-coded document difficulty indicators and the option to select the desired level of complexity. This personalization ensures that users are not overwhelmed by overly technical information and can access resources that match their comprehension and needs.\n\n<div style="width: 90%; align: center">\n[[Image:Helper.jpeg|class=img-responsive|Grapevine System]]\n</div>\n\nUnderlying HELPeR’s user-centric interface is a sophisticated architecture, encapsulated in Figure 2, which is composed of three primary pipelines: document collection, user profiling, and presentation. The document collection pipeline is dedicated to curating current and credible information, while the user profiling pipeline leverages data from health providers and patient activities to create detailed user profiles. These profiles then inform the presentation pipeline, ensuring that the system delivers the most relevant and personalized content. Built on a native graph database, HELPeR offers quick and responsive interactions, making it an efficient tool for users seeking specific information. This system not only bridges the information gap for ovarian cancer patients and caregivers but also sets a precedent in health informatics by providing a tailored, interactive, and adaptive platform for medical information dissemination.\n\n<div style="width: 90%; align: center">\n[[Image:Helper arch.jpeg|class=img-responsive|Grapevine System]]\n</div>\n\nThis project is funded by NIH through the National Library of Medicine by grant [https://www.grantome.com/grant/NIH/R01-LM013038-02 R01-LM013038-02] (2019 - 2023).\n\n==Research Team==\nThis project is a collaboration between the School of Nursing and the School of Computing and Information, University of Pittsburgh.\n===School of Computing and Information===\n\n* '''PI:''' Daqing He, [[User:Peterb|Peter Brusilovsky]]\n\n* Graduate researchers: Behnam Rahdari, Khushboo Thaker, Zhenmin Hong, Mohammad Hassany\n\n===School of Nursing===\n* '''PI:''' Young Ji Lee, Heidi Donovan\n* Postdoctoral researchers: Susan Birkhoff, Leah Rosenblum\n* Graduate researchers: Yu Chi, Vivian Hui, Youjia Wang\n\n===University Library System===\nSP: Mary Lou Klem\n\n==Systems==\n\n* [[HELPeR]]\n\n==Project Home Page==\nFor a detailed description of our vision and goals, see the [http://www.pitt.edu/~dah44/helper/ home page of the project ]\n\n==Publications==\n\n* Chi, Y., Thaker, K., He, D., Hui, V., Donovan, H., Brusilovsky, P., and Lee, Y.

The project was funded by the National Science Foundation by [https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1822752&HistoricalAwards=false Award 1822752] between 2018 and 2023. In the course of the project, we developed and evaluated open-learned modeling approaches, code-tracing tools to practice code comprehension, and an intelligent tutor for assessing code comprehension through explanations.\n\n== Motivation ==\nComputing skills, such as computer programming, are an integral part of many disciplines, including the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). Although such skills are in high demand, and the number of aspiring Computer Science (CS) students is encouraging, a large gap between the supply of CS graduates and the demand persists because, for instance, college CS programs suffer from high attrition rates in introductory CS courses. One reason for the high attrition rates in introductory CS courses is the inherent complexity of CS concepts and tasks. To help students better cope with the high level of complexity, this project investigates a novel education technology, called CSEdPad (CS Education Pad), meant to ease students' introduction to programming during their early encounters with CS concepts and tasks. Moreover, the project forges new frontiers in CS education through a research program that advances our understanding of students' source code comprehension, learning, and motivational processes. The CSEdPad project has the potential to transform how students perceive computer science, increase their programming skills and self-efficacy, and lead to increased retention rates. The result will be a win-win-win situation for aspiring students, CS programs and their organizations, and the overall economy.\n\nThe CSEdPad system design brings to bear proven educational technologies and techniques to improve students' mental model construction, learning, engagement, and retention in CS education. In particular, the system targets source code comprehension, a critical skill for both learners and professionals. It monitors and scaffolds source code comprehension processes while students engage in a variety of code comprehension tasks. Key approaches being explored include Animated Pedagogical Agents, self-explanation, and the Open Social Learner Model. Outcome variables include comprehension measures, learning gains, engagement level, retention, and self-efficacy. Due to its interdisciplinary nature, the project will impact several fields including Computer Science education, cognitive psychology, intelligent tutoring systems, and artificial intelligence. Students participating in the experiments will be selected from a diverse student body with respect to gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. An increase in recruitment and retention of students from these populations will have far-reaching implications.\n\n== Teams == \n\n===University of Pittsburgh Team===\n\n* '''PI:''' [[User:Peterb|Peter Brusilovsky]]\n\n* Graduate researchers: Zak Risha, Kamil Akhuseyinoglu, Arun LR\n\n===University of Memphis Team===\n* '''PI:''' Vasile Rus\n\n* Graduate researchers: Lasang Tamang, Priti Oli, Jeevan Chapagian, Rabin Banjade\n\n\n== Publications ==\n\n* Tamang, L.

It features a search box, a list of suggested keywords, sliders for adjusting research interests, and a display of potential advisors. This design enables students to actively engage in refining their research preferences, helping them to clarify and articulate their interests more effectively. Detailed advisor profiles, as seen in Figure 2, offer in-depth information about each advisor’s research areas, assisting students in making informed decisions. The system's underlying knowledge graph, shown in Figure 3, links advisors, research topics, and keywords to generate personalized recommendations, adapting to each student's evolving research interests.\n\n<div style="width: 50%; align: center">\n[[Image:Helper advisor profile.jpeg|class=img-responsive|Grapevine System]]\n</div>\n\nIn essence, Grapevine serves as a practical and accessible platform for undergraduate students embarking on their research journeys.

Anomia (i.e., word-finding difficulty) is a primary frustration for people with aphasia, and naming treatments for anomia are both widely researched and commonly used in clinical practice. For naming treatments to make a meaningful impact on the lives of people with aphasia, they must produce durable gains in word-finding which generalize beyond the treatment context. However, most theoretically-motivated naming treatment research fails to address the long- term retention of trained words and their generalization to connected speech, limiting their clinical impact. Prevailing learning theory suggests that “desirable difficulty” improves treatment retention and generalization. The current proposal therefore seeks to improve the durability and context generalization of computer-based naming treatment by incorporating model-based algorithms to adaptively maintain desirable difficulty. We will test two distinct models in parallel clinical trials. Our central premise is that these models will facilitate a balance between what have historically been framed as contrasting learning approaches: errorless learning vs. effortful retrieval (Study 1) and massed vs. distributed practice (Study 2). Instead, our models will integrate these approaches by replacing extreme static contrasts with continuous task components which can be adaptively modified based on ongoing patient performance. Study 1 will adaptively balance effort and accuracy using speeded naming deadlines based on a model we have developed which characterizes individuals’ speed-accuracy tradeoffs in picture naming over time. Study 2 will manipulate trial spacing using an adaptive scheduling and memory decay model built into widely available, open-source flashcard software. In both studies, we predict that when compared to matched traditional non-adaptive treatment conditions, our adaptive conditions will produce more successful retention of trained words 3 and 6 months post-treatment on naming probes (Aims 1a, 2a), and better context generalization to connected speech when tested on complex scene descriptions containing untrained exemplars of trained words (Aims 1b, 2b). We also predict that adaptive trial spacing in Study 2 will successfully train many more words than is possible in current standard care. In addition, data generated in Studies 1 and 2 will be used to develop the next generation of adaptive timing models (Aims 1c and 2c), spurring future innovations in personalized medicine. Successful clinical trial outcomes will demonstrate that adaptive computer-based naming treatments provide a novel way to produce large, durable, and generalizable treatment gains, and positive Study 2 findings could be immediately implemented in clinical practice at scale using free open-source software. Successful modeling outcomes will lead to even more effective interventions and lay the groundwork for a transformative research agenda that could ultimately lead to comprehensive adaptive learning systems for aphasia rehabilitation.

0	Investigating_and_Evaluating_Exploratory_Recommender_Systems	== Overview ==\nThis project is focused on a popular category of interactive Recommender Systems (RecSys) known as user-controlled RecSys. The idea of user-controlled RecSys is to engage the user in controlling some aspects of the recommendation process such as choosing peers for collaborative filtering, fusing several recommender algorithms, or deducing user current preferences. While the traditional data-driven approaches estimate these parameters from data trying to optimize the results across many users and contexts, in many cases user data is not sufficient to make a reliable “guess”. As demonstrated by many existing examples, leaving control over some aspects of the recommendation process to the user avoids guessing and leads to a better user experience in each specific case. A good example of simple user control is the carousel-based interface in some industrial recommenders. This approach leaves it to the user to choose which category of items they are currently interested in instead of the traditional attempt to “guess” it with too little information and offer users a single ranked list.\n\nThe target of this proposal is algorithms for user-controlled recommendation. While recent work on user-controlled RecSys demonstrated the value of this approach, this stream of research predominantly used simple recommer algorithms. In other words, the focus was on the user at the expense of the AI. In this project, we want to restore the balance by developing a better generation of recommender algorithms that can benefit from user control.\n\n== Fundning ==\n\nThe project is supported by Amazon Research Award to Peter Brusilovsky\n\n== Publications ==\n* Rahdari, B., Brusilovsky, P., and Sabet, A.

0	An_Infrastructure_for_Sustainable_Innovation_and_Research_in_Computer_Science_Education	== Overview ==\nResearchers from the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, North Carolina State University, and Virginia Tech collaborate to support the Computer Science Education Hub, social and technical infrastructure to accelerate research on teaching and learning of computing disciplines. The Hub will host community events and provide a web repository for computing education datasets, tools, and common analysis methods. The Hub facilitates the creation and adoption of new tools to support computing educators and students, and new standards to support data collection and data-enabled research. Hub community events help researchers and educators from many learning contexts to develop and improve computing education resources.\n\nThe Hub provides a pioneering example of infrastructure to support data-enabled research on education in Computing and beyond. It advances Computing Education Research through: (1) building a community and website that helps instructors adopt evidence-based practices and innovative learning technologies, (2) creating data standards and large, high-quality datasets, (3) developing advanced algorithms using artificial intelligence, statistics, and analytics methods that leverage data to optimize student learning effectiveness, efficiency, and engagement, (4) developing rigorous evaluation methods to demonstrate large, lasting, and replicable impacts on student achievement. Cross-disciplinary scientific advances are disseminated through the Hub infrastructure community and scientific publications.\n\nThis project follows our earlier infrastructure community-development project "[[Community-Building and Infrastructure Design for Data-Intensive Research in Computer Science Education]]". It is supported by NSF award [https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2213789&HistoricalAwards=false CNS 2213789 (2017-2021)].\n\n== Project Web Site ==\n\nTo distribute project-related information, we maintain the project website [http://cssplice.org/ http://cssplice.org/], where all project information including standards, best practices, and resources are be shared. It informs the community about events and opportunities to contribute. The site provides links to project publications, code, data, and learning content hosted in archival repositories such as GitHub and DataShop.\n\n== Call for Collaborators: What we can offer ==\n\n=== Reusable Smart Learning Content===\nWe have many types of “smart learning content” (various interactive problems and examples) for Java, Python, SQL. Content could be re-used in other classes individually, or as a package through personalized Mastery Grids interface. \n* Read more about it in the [[Smart Content]] section of the Wiki\n* See demos of our “old” content for \n** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI9Fxo_FeRw Java]\n** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roCkp7QVfB8 Python]\n** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbiq7T7rx-k SQL]\n\n===Adaptive practice system===\nWe have an infrastructure that allows building flexible practice systems (which students could use on their own) for Java, Python, SQL. The system allows to create support for any course in the field - you define a sequence of topics, assign content to topics, and receive a fully-ready system with an adaptive interface. The system supports our own smart content and several types of interoperable content created by our collaborators. In total, there are 7 types of content for Python, 6 types for Java and 6 types for SQL.\nWe can help you to create a custom support exactly for your course. The system could be used to run extensive classroom studies and collect data. Read more about it here\nhttp://kt1.exp.sis.pitt.edu/wiki/Adaptive_Navigation_Support_and_Open_Social_Learner_Modeling_for_PAL\nAlso, watch (not the most recent) demo at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76YLR2VY2QE\n\n== Call for Collaborators: What we are looking for==\n===More Smart Learning Content!===\nWe are interested in collaborating with other developers of smart learning content to make it more interoperable and to feature in our personalized systems for Python, Java, and SQL. \n===More Studies with Data Collection===\nOur ultimate goal is to learn more about how people learn programming and better support them with adaptive educational systems. To get there we need to run more studies of different type of smart learning content and different personalization approaches. We want to partner with instructors in Java, Python and Database classes who are interested to engage their student in practicing computer science concepts with different types of smart learning content. See what we have in “When we can offer” section above and get in touch! It is a great chance to make interesting discoveries and publish good papers.\nIn particular, we just developed PCLab system with several new types of learning content to support learning program construction skills - for which we have the least data. We are especially interested to run studies of this new content.\nSee PCLab demos for Python (http://bit.ly/pclab-python) and Java (http://bit.ly/pclab-java)\n\n== Systems ==\nProject partners developed a number of systems and tools for Computer Science Education.

2	Behnam	My passion lies at the overlap of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the challenge of integrating the two fields. Currently, I'm pursuing my Ph.D. at the University of Pittsburgh's School of Computing and Information, under the guidance of Dr. Peter Brusilovsky, head of the PAWS Lab.\n\nMy research focuses on building and evaluating search and recommender systems that are user-centric and intelligent. I design solutions that integrate AI algorithms with user-friendly interfaces, effectively bridging the gap between high-level AI technologies and their practical applications. This approach underlines my commitment to making advanced technologies accessible and beneficial for everyone in their everyday contexts.\n\nHaving been fortunate to receive support from esteemed institutions such as National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Science Foundation (NSF), National Library of Medicine (NLM), and Amazon Research Awards (ARA) among others, my work is a testament to the potential of combining UX principles with the robustness of AI. These projects range from design and implementation of multiple online systems for healthcare (addressing IBD, ovarian cancer, and aphasia) and education (involving student advisement, e-readers, and the exploration of academic and medical documents), as well as more theoretical research on probabilistic models and simulation-based evaluation of interactive recommender systems.\n\nThe fusion of AI and HCI offers a promising horizon, and I am enthusiastic about the advancements we can achieve in this domain. With every research project and publication, I am committed to pushing this frontier, ensuring technology is more aligned with its users.

0	Content_Invocation_protocols	This page describes the content invocation protocols supported by [[ADAPT2|ADAPT<sup>2</sup>]] \n\n== Why Content Invocation? ==\n\nA content invocation protocol allows two online learning systems to work together in supporting learners. With this protocol, a '''host system''', such as a learning portal, a learning management system, or a personalized learning interface) can activate an independent '''client system''' while also passing a range of important parameters to it, most importantly, information about the user and group who will work with the client system, and the user target. The target might indicate a specific activity that the client system will need to launch for the user, while the information about the user and group enables the client system to customize its interaction with the user. The information about the user and the target is also important to log the information about the user interaction with the tool.\n\nWhen [[ADAPT2|ADAPT<sup>2</sup>]] was originally developed in 2002, it implemented its own content invocation protocol, since no other protocols supported personalized invocation of external learning content at that time. As other protocols gradually evolved, an increasing volume of interactive learning objects that implemented these protocols was developed. To leverage this content, [[ADAPT2|ADAPT<sup>2</sup>]] components now support other content invocation protocols.\n\n== [[ADAPT2|ADAPT<sup>2</sup>]] protocol for user authentication and activity invocation ==\n\n[[ADAPT2|ADAPT<sup>2</sup>]] content invocation protocol is the "native" protocol of [[ADAPT2|ADAPT<sup>2</sup>]] infrastructure. \nThis protocol is adopted by all [[ADAPT2|ADAPT<sup>2</sup>]] tools developed by our teams and by many content servers developers by our collaborators. \nIt regulates how user and resource identities is transferred from application to application via the following HTTP parameters (see [[ADAPT2|ADAPT<sup>2</sup>]] [[CUMULATE protocol#Parameter Naming Conventions|Parameter Naming Conventions]])\n\n* '''usr''' - user identifier, usually login (mandatory)\n* '''grp''' - group identifier (mandatory), just like a user identifier, but for a group of users (class, research team)\n* '''sid''' - session identifier (optional), usually 5 character string each application makes a choice whether and how to come up with this parameter (e.g. truncate [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Tomcat | Apache Tomcat] session id to last 5 characters)\n*  '''act''' - id of the resource (mandatory), each application maintains its own vocabulary of resource ids\n* '''sub''' - if a resource is a collection of multiple resources/steps, then a sub-resource id is supplied to call a specific sub-resource or step (optional)\n* '''svc''' – service parameter – any character string that can be used to store system state, should not contain ? (question mark), & (ampersand), : (colon), and / (backward slash); however all those symbols can be encoded using Java URLEncoder class that maps them to %XX; service parameter (optional)\n* '''cid''' - course id that defines the course in which this content is being requested (optional). This parameter is different than grp because there could be multiple groups within a single course. \n\n[[ADAPT2|ADAPT<sup>2</sup>]] content invocation protocol is "stackable". It could be used by a learning portal to call a specific learning object for the user to work with, but can be also used to call a specific personalized service or shell to assist the user. By receiving information about the user, the service could call a specific learning content for this user, passing down the same parameters.\n\n=== Example invocation requests ===\nBelow, there is an example invocation request to access a learning content using [[ADAPT2|ADAPT<sup>2</sup>]] content invocation protocol.\n\n'''Request URL Format''':\n<pre>\nhttp|https://<content_url>?app=<application_id> &act=<learning_object> &sub=<learning_object_step> &usr=<user> &gpr=<group> &sid=<session_id> &svc=<service_parameters> & cid=<course_id>\n</pre> \n\nCheck above for more details about the URL parameters used in this request. The content URL defines where this content is being hosted and could contain content-specific parameters. [[ADAPT2|ADAPT<sup>2</sup>]] URL parameters should be appended if there are any content-specific URL parameters.  \n\nFor example, to invoke a PCRS coding activity using this protocol, the following URL can be used:\n\n<pre>\nhttps://PCRS_URL?act=PCRS&sub=rectangle_perimeter&svc=masterygrids&grp=groupid&usr=userid&sid=sessionid&cid=courseid\n</pre>\n\nHere, PCRS_URL should be replaced with an actual URL obtained from the content provider. \n\n\n== Other Standard authentication and content invocation protocols supported by [[ADAPT2|ADAPT<sup>2</sup>]] ==\n\n=== LTI protocol ===\nMore detailed information can be find here: [https://cssplice.org/lti/index.html SPLICE LTI Tutorials]\n=== SPLICE protocol ===\nMore information about SPLICE Protocol can be found here: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X6Vx6Em67t8Vp4Vecnmc-7OblVewJJKDFIJUrvRAvdc/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.vxcmu24ix9zg SPLICE Protocol Description]
