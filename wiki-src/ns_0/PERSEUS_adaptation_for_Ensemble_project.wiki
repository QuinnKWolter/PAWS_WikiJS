= About Ensemble =\n[[Ensemble]]  is a new NSF NSDL Pathways project working to establish a national, distributed digital library for computing education. Our project is building a distributed portal providing access to a broad range of existing educational resources for computing while preserving the collections and their associated curation processes. We want to encourage contribution, use, reuse, review and evaluation of educational materials at multiple levels of granularity and we seek to support the full range of computing education communities including computer science, computer engineering, software engineering, information science, information systems and information technology as well as other areas often called “computing + X” or “X informatics.”\n\n= Overview =\n[[Image:Portal-group-social-navigation.png|thumb|'''100'''|Figure 1. Group-based social navigation]]\n[[Image:Portal-group-n-individual-social-navigation.png|thumb|'''100'''|Figure 2. Group-based and individual social navigation]]\nThe main goal of enhancing Ensemble portal (http://www.computingportal.org) with adaptation is to provide an extra value to the rich collection of resources that the portal is currently hosting. Out of a large set of possible adaptation techniques we selected the one that captures the social traits of portal users. Namely, visualizes users' browsing behaviors.\n\nIn Figure 1 there is a screenshot of an existing portal page with adaptive navigation cues added. Here green bullets of various shades denote the intensity of the users' click traffic: the darker the shade - the more clicks visits the page has. Here users are not distinguished from each other. Instead, a page-viewing behavior of a community of all portal users is visualized. Figure 2 is a more elaborate example where each individual user is contrasted to the rest of the community. The bullet background represents the whole user community, an the foreground person icon denotes an individual user.\n\nFor the adaptation to work, Ensemble portal has to "cooperate" with the adaptation providers. There are two components that are responsible for adaptation.\n# User modeling server [[CUMULATE]], that collects user page-viewing behavior. Portal should be able to send page-view events containing the viewed page URL and potentially additional information about the user.\n# Adaptation server [[PERSEUS]], that, upon request, renders a visualization of aggregated user viewing-behaviors collected by the user modeling server. Portal should be able to query [[PERSEUS]] to obtain navigation icons (just like those in figure 1 and 2) for links on a particular portal page (all or a subset). It should also to be able to parse the [[PERSEUS]]'s response and paste these icons on the rendered page.\n\n= Implementation =\n\n== Reporting users's page-views ==\nThis par is absolutely necessary. Adaptation requires a special kind of user-data processing and cannot be easily implemented as a plugin for Drupal (the basis for Ensemble portal). Portal has to send an HTTP GET request to the [[CUMULATE|user modeling server's]] listening url that contains:\n* URL of the page being viewed\n* Some form of user identity (e.g. client IP address or portal login). This information is optional but desirable to be able to support a more advanced adaptation such as the one in Figure 2.\n\n== Requesting adaptation ("easy", abandoned) ==\n[[Image:Ensemble-embedlet-browser.png|thumb|'''100'''|Figure 3. [[PERSEUS]] embedlet rendered in a browser]]\nAdaptation can be provided in a fairly painless manner by inserting '''embed''' HTML tags, just like those [http://www.youtube.com YouTube] offers. [[PERSEUS]]'s embedlet is, in some way, an iframe and [[PERSEUS]] assumes full responsibility to render links' presentation (see Figure 3 for an example of embedlet's rendering in a browser).\n\nThe use of these '''embedlets''' requires for the list of links adaptation is provided for to be cached in advance, so that the enumeration of links to be adaptively presented can be done in a concise manner and the invoked embedlet URL does not exceed 255 characters.\n\nEmbedlet could work in both group-based mode providing adaptation similar to the one shown in Figure 1, or group-and-individual mode, similar to the one shown in Figure 2.\n\n== Requesting adaptation ("hard", implemented) ==\nHere the Content Management System (CMS) has to be more engaged but the solution is more flexible.\n\nThe two requirements for the CMS that is has to be able to send a query to [[PERSEUS]] with a list of links to adapt and to be able to parse the response. Concrete format of the request/response is not important, since a special version of the adaptation services would be built for [[Ensemble]].\n\nThe following is a working draft for invoking [[PERSEUS]] adaptation (HTTP POST request is a must):\n* '''http://adapt2.sis.pitt.edu/pservice/service/ensemble-sn/invoke/ensemble-sn''' is a base URL of PERSEUS social navigation support service for [[Ensemble]]\n* HTTP POST should be used to invoke, HTTP GET to access a 'manual' mode for testing\n* '''user_id''' - user id login of the logged-in portal user; currently meta user '''meta_ensemble''' should be used\n* '''group_id''' group id, id of the portal community; currently meta community '''meta_group''' should be used\n* '''uri''' -  list of links to adapt; these are the links sent to CUMULATE with reports of user clicks; the list items should be separated by CR (carriage return)\n* '''vis_id''' - an id of a visualizer that formats the output by selecting appropriate annotations for the aggregated numerical values; at this point should be equal to '''ensemble-sn-shadeviz'''; alternatively '''/vis/ensemble-sn-shadeviz/''' could be added at the end of the base URL to achieve the same result, so the URL would be '''http://adapt2.sis.pitt.edu/pservice/service/ensemble-sn/invoke/ensemble-sn/vis/ensemble-sn-shadeviz'''\n* returned response is a list of annotations - HTML snippets (e.g. img tag and maybe something extra) to be placed in front of the link; the order of annotations is the same as in the request.\n\n== Relevant Links ==\n* [http://www.computingportal.org/ Ensemble Computing Portal]\n* [[CUMULATE_protocol|Protocol]] for exchanging data with [[CUMULATE]]'s user model, in particular - a [[CUMULATE_protocol#Protocol_for_reporting_user_activity|section]] on how to send clicks to the user model\n* [http://www.computingportal.org/admin/settings/navigation_cues Module for sending user clicks to CUMULATE settings page] (authentication necessary)\n\n= Progress Blog =\n* 13:49, 9 July 2010 (EDT) : Drupal Rules module identified as a way to redirect user clicks to [[CUMULATE]] UMS\n* 18:27, 15 July 2010 (EDT) : [[CUMULATE]] configured for accepting test input of Ensemble portal user navigation reports via [[CUMULATE_protocol#Protocol_for_reporting_user_activity|this]] protocol.
