Consequently, the need has arisen to move from prototypical systems to scalable, deployable solutions. At the same time, a shift can be seen from rule-based, mentalistic user modeling approaches to 'Web 2.0' approaches that involve machine learning, data mining, and collaborative techniques. \n\nPast research provided a large body of methods for adaptation/personalization, and techniques for user modeling, usage mining, and collaborative filtering. Conceptual frameworks splitting the adaptation process into various layers provide guidance for implementing user-adaptive systems. Based on these building blocks, various groups have created their own frameworks, among others AHA!, APELS, and Personal Reader. Framework design provides an opportunity to reuse components or even whole layers of the adaptation process. Reuse of components such as user behavior observation and logging tools, user model storage promotes faster development, better feature selection, and more robust systems.\n\nAlthough, system fragmentation enables component reuse and speeds up the development of the new systems, there are several issues. First, decomposition of a monolithic system should result in a good abstraction of the data and process model to provide a convenient basis for reuse. Second, the data traffic between the separated system components may intensify. As the number of system users increases issues related to scalability might arise. This is especially true for user-adaptive and cognitive systems where the modeling and personalization components are traditionally computationally and data intensive. \n\nExisting work on the Web-based user-adaptive and cognitive systems, including work on frameworks, shown that there exists a strong overlap between conceptual models of the decomposed adaptation process and the practical implications of its design. In this situation, a logical step is to compare already working systems with emerging approaches and models. In this workshop we seek to identify current practices and experiences with concrete implementations of user-adaptive and cognitive systems or specific components - varying from experimental, small-scale prototypes to systems that are deployed on a larger scale.\n\n=Topics=\nTopics include but are not limited to: \n* user behavior observation and user data collection: embedded into the adaptive system or available as standalone components or add-ons, \n* user data management: data storage platforms and formats, the use of open standards, querying techniques or APIs, interoperability issues, \n* reusing reasoning and adaptation techniques,\n* scalability and performance issues of user modeling and adaptation, \n* generalizable techniques for adaptation, personalization and recommendation, \n* translations of conceptual designs into concrete implementation, \n* deployment issues and lessons learned (case studies and evaluation).\n\n=Proceedings=\nProceedings have been published at [http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-609 http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-609]\n\n=Call for papers=\n[[Media:Wabbwuas.umap2010.cfp.txt|TXT]] and [[Media:Wabbwuas.umap2010.cfp.pdf|PDF]]\n\n=Program=\n* 8:00 - 9:30\n** Generic Adaptation Process (long paper, 30min)<br/>''Evgeny Knutov, Paul De Bra and Mykola Pechenizkiy''\n** Towards a Generic Platform for Indoor Positioning using Existing Infrastructure and Symbolic Maps (short paper, 15min)<br/>''Kurt Gubi, Rainer Wasinger, Michael Fry, Judy Kay and Tsvi Kuflik''\n** Ontology-Driven Adaptive Accessible Interfaces in the INREDIS project (short paper, 15min)<br/>''Raul Minon, Amaia Aizpurua, Idoia Cearreta, Nestor Garay, Julio Abascal''\n** Building Blocks for User Modeling with data from the Social Web (short paper, 15min)<br/>''Fabian Abel, Nicola Henze, Eelco Herder, Geert-Jan Houben, Daniel Krause and Erwin Leonardi''\n* 9:30 - 10:00 Coffee break\n* 10:00 - 11:30\n** Student modeling services for hybrid web applications (long paper, 30 min)<br/>''Ivan Cruces, Monica Trella, Ricardo Conejo and Jaime Galvez''\n** PERSEUS – Personalization Services Engine (demo, 15 min)<br/>''Michael Yudelson''\n** Discussion (45min)\n* 11:30 - 1:00 Lunch\n\n=Important dates=\n\n* April 12, 2010 - Submissions due (23:59 pm Hawaiian time)\n* May 3, 2010 - Notification of acceptance\n* May 24, 2010 - Camera-ready versions due\n* June 21, 2010 - Workshop day\n\n=Submission=\nAll papers should represent original and unpublished work that is not currently under review.\n\nSubmission types\n* Full paper (12 pages maximum)\n* Short paper (6 pages maximum)\n* Demo (3 pages)\n\nFormat\n* LNCS instructions for authors can be found [http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-7-72376-0 here]\n\nSubmission procedure \n* Submit your contributions electronically in PDF format  via [http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wabbwuas2010 EasyChair]\n\nReview\n* Each submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the workshop program committee.\n* Papers will be evaluated according to their significance, originality, technical content, style, clarity  and relevance to the workshop.\n\nThere  will  be  no  separate  workshop  registration  fees.
