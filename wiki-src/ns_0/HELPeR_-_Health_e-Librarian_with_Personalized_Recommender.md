Ovarian cancer, a complex and challenging disease, requires patients and
caregivers to carefully review vast array of medical information to make
informed health decisions. To assist in this endeavor, the project
'HELPeR: Health e-Librarian with Personalized Recommender' has been
developed. This innovative system aims to empower ovarian cancer
patients and caregivers by providing personalized, accessible, and
up-to-date information. Recognizing the diverse health literacy levels
and specific informational needs of users, HELPeR is designed to
streamline the process of finding reliable, relevant, and recent
resources. This system could benefit patients in a landscape where
patients and caregivers often face overwhelming amounts of data, varying
in quality and relevance.\n\nAt the heart of HELPeR's utility is its
user-friendly interface, which allows for intuitive navigation and
interaction with a vast array of resources. As depicted in Figure 1, the
interface features a straightforward layout with a search bar, filtering
options, and a carousel display for search results. This design is
deliberately chosen to ensure ease of use and familiarity for users of
all backgrounds. The system's unique feature is its ability to adapt to
the user's health literacy level, highlighted by color-coded document
difficulty indicators and the option to select the desired level of
complexity. This personalization ensures that users are not overwhelmed
by overly technical information and can access resources that match
their comprehension and needs.\n\n

\n\nUnderlying HELPeR’s user-centric interface is a sophisticated
architecture, encapsulated in Figure 2, which is composed of three
primary pipelines: document collection, user profiling, and
presentation. The document collection pipeline is dedicated to curating
current and credible information, while the user profiling pipeline
leverages data from health providers and patient activities to create
detailed user profiles. These profiles then inform the presentation
pipeline, ensuring that the system delivers the most relevant and
personalized content. Built on a native graph database, HELPeR offers
quick and responsive interactions, making it an efficient tool for users
seeking specific information. This system not only bridges the
information gap for ovarian cancer patients and caregivers but also sets
a precedent in health informatics by providing a tailored, interactive,
and adaptive platform for medical information dissemination.\n\n
