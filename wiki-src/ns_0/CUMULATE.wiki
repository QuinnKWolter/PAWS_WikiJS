It collects evidence (events) about student learning from multiple servers that interact with the student. It stores students' activities and infers their learning characteristics, which are the basis for an individual adaptation to them. ... External and internal inference agents process the flow of events and update the values in the inference model of the server. Each inference agent is responsible for maintaining a specific property in the inference model, such as the current motivation level of the student or the student's current level of knowledge for each course topic...</blockquote>\n<div align="right">Kobsa, A.

It is mainly targeted at providing user modeling support for adaptive educational hypermedia (AEH) systems. [[CUMULATE]]'s data model consists of the following.\n* users, groups of users, and group membership links (syndicated from [[Knowledge Tree]])\n* learning objects, learning object providers (client applications)\n* knowledge components - concepts - grouped in learning domains\n* learning object metadata index - links between learning objects and corresponding concepts\n* user activity log - historical log of all reported user interaction with learning objects\n* assertions about user's knowledge of concepts ([concepts'] knowledge)\n* summaries of user's interaction with learning objects, such as: number of attempts, percent complete, etc. ([learning objects'] progress)\n[[CUMULATE]] implements several inference mechanisms to produce assertions about user's knowledge and progress, including the following.\n* time-spent-reading (reading texts via [[Knowledge Sea II]] and [[AnnotatEd]])\n* thresholded averaging (browsing examples via [[WebEx]] and exploring expressions via [[WADEIn]])\n* [[CUMULATE asymptotic knowledge assessment|asymptotic assessment of user knowledge]] (problem solving via [[QuizPACK]], [[QuizJET]], and [[SQLKnoT]], which is the main one deployed in our systems)\n* [[CUMULATE parametrized asymptotic knowledge assessment|parametrized asymptotic assessment of user knowledge]] (<span style="color:maroon;">under development</span>)\n* knowledge tracing (<span style="color:maroon;">under consideration</span>)\n* [[Feature-Aware Student knowledge Tracing (FAST)|Feature-Aware Student knowledge Tracing (FAST)]] (<span style="color:maroon;">under development</span>)\n\n== Modeling User's Knowledge ==\n[[Image:CUMULATE.evidence propagation.png|thumb|'''100'''|Evindence propagation in CUMULATE]]\n[[CUMULATE]] models user's knowledge of concepts with respect to the following levels of [http://www.officeport.com/edu/blooms.htm Bloom's taxonomy].\n* knowledge - corresponds to reading tutorials or book chapters ([[Knowledge Sea II]], [[AnnotatEd]])\n* comprehension - reviewing examples, watching demos ([[WebEx]], [[WADEIn]] demo mode)\n* application - answering quiz questions ([[QuizPACK]], [[QuizJET]], [[WADEIn]] evaluation mode)\n* synthesis - constructing problem solutions ([[SQLKnoT]])\nUpon receipt of new information about user activity (interaction with a learning object), [[CUMULATE]] first verifies the integrity of the reported information (user is registered, learning object provider is known and learning object exists, etc.). Then, based on the learning object provider and result of interaction, it is determined what inference mechanism to use and what [http://www.officeport.com/edu/blooms.htm Bloom's level] to affect. [[CUMULATE]] then looks up the domain concepts for the learning object the user interacted with and performs the update of the knowledge. Summaries of progress with learning objects are updated as well. The process of updating user model is called '''evidence propagation''' (see figure on the left).<br/>\n\n<span style="color:red;">New!</span> Recent update to [[CUMULATE]] allows learning object providers to skip learning object metadata lookup and report changes in user's knowledge of domain concepts directly.\n\n== Entry Points and Protocols ==\n[[CUMULATE]] has 3 major entry points:\n# interface for reporting user interaction with learning objects\n# interface for reporting changes to user knowledge of concepts in-the-raw (<span style="color:red;">new</span>)\n# interface for acquiring models of user knowledge/progress as a whole or in part\n\nTo communicate with these entry points, a Web-based personalized learning system has to use a set of standard user modeling protocols known as [[CUMULATE protocol|CUMULATE protocols]].\n\n==Publications==\n<onlyinclude>\n* Zadorozhny, V., [[User:myudelson|Yudelson, M.]], and [[User:peterb|Brusilovsky, P.]] (2008) '''A Framework for Performance Evaluation of User Modeling Servers for Web Applications'''.
