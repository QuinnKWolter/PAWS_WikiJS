NameSieve news filtering series supports filtering by named entities.
Even though the personalization is not supported yet, users are provided
with the interface with which they can select important names extracted
from the ad-hoc retrieval lists. By selecting some relevant names, they
can post-filter the original retrieval lists and get the ones that only
contain those names.\n![NameSieve
