In this section we explain some of the recommender approaches that has been developed and used in Mastery Grids.\n\n== ProActive Recommendation ==\nThese recommender systems require no trigger. They are represented in Mastery Grids interface as stars on the topic and learning resources. The size of star shows the importance (weight) of recommended material. Two recommender systems has been implemented in this setting: Adaptive Sequencing, and Probabilistic Outspread approaches.\nAdaptive sequencing is a greedy sequencing approach aimed at maximizing each student’s level of knowledge and activities. The learning material are ranked by balancing the knowledge level of each student in the prerequisite concepts of the learning material with the knowledge that can be gained from the outcome concepts.\nThe probabilistic outspread approach aims to select the learning material that increases the probability of the student solving all of the quizzes in the course. It uses FAST as its underlying probabilistic model of student's knowledge and performance.\n \n[[Image:StarRecommendation.png|325x650px]]\n\n== ReActive Recommendation ==\nThese recommendations occur only when student fails in solving a question correctly in Mastery Grids. The student is going to be suggested some examples that can help the student acquire the skills needed to solve the original question.\n\n[[Image:Reactive_rec.jpg|700x600px]]\n\n\n== Recommendations inside Examples ==\nThe goal of this work was to extend WebEx with more advanced knowledge-based link annotation that could guide users to the most appropriate lines by showing how much knowledge about the concepts presented in each line the user already mastered. The new functionality was made feasible by two intelligent technologies: the ability to automatically identify programming concepts associated with each line of code using concept parser and dynamic student model that maintains the current level of student knowledge for each concept. Using the current level of knowledge for concepts associated with each line, we can calculate how much knowledge associated with each line is already known to the learner. We expected that visualizing this dynamically (i.e., displaying the amount of knowledge as a visual cue next to the line) could help users to select most important lines. We also wanted to directly recommend most important lines to explore to the user.\n\n[[Image:ANS_example.jpg|600x500px]]\n\n== Publications ==\n* Hosseini, R., Brusilovsky, P., and Guerra, J.
