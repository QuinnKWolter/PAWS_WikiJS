## Summary

\nA variety of educational resources such as tutorials, electronic
textbooks, and subject overviews are now available on the Web for almost
every subject. Finding high quality educational resources is much less
of a problem with modern Web search engines and DL search services.
However, the resources that one finds have different presentation
styles, target audiences, and coverage; many resources are highly
redundant. The abundance of resources has created another problem: How
to help students find, organize, and use resources that match their
individual goals, interests, and current knowledge. In brief, access is
not the issue; personalized access is.\nIn the context of this project
we are developing a new generation of techniques for personalized access
to open corpus educational resources. Our main foci are adaptive
navigation support and adaptive visualization - the least investigated
areas on the map of personalized information access research. These
technologies support a higher level of interactivity and expressive
power than what is now offered by modern adaptive information retrieval
and filtering systems and take into account not just the interests, but
also the current knowledge and goals of their users.\nIn a range of
smaller-scale projects and systems listed below we are exploring and
developing techniques that can provide adaptive navigation support for
browsing-based access to open corpus resources and support information
access through adaptive information visualization. The systems and tools
we are developing are open for the educational use in other
universities. We are also interested in collaborating with teams who
share our goals and interests.\n\n==Funding
