## Overview

\n\nOnline educational systems, and the large-scale data streams that
they generate, have the potential to\ntransform education as well as our
scientific understanding of learning. Computer Science Education\n(CSE)
researchers are increasingly making use of large collections of data
generated by the click streams\ncoming from eTextbooks, interactive
programming environments, and other smart content. However,\nCSE
research faces barriers that slow progress: \n\n\* Collection of
computer science learning process and outcome data generated by one
system is not compatible with that from other systems.\n\* Computer
science problem solving and learning (e.g., open-ended coding solutions
to complex problems) is quite different from the type of data (e.g.,
discrete answers to questions or verbal responses) that current
educational data mining focuses on.\n\nThe project goal is to build
community and capacity among CSE researchers, data scientists,
and\nlearning scientists toward reducing these barriers and facilitating
the full potential of data-intensive\nresearch on learning and improving
computer science education. We are bringing together CSE tool
build\ncommunities with learning science and technology researchers
toward a software infrastructure that\nsupports scaled and sustainable
data-intensive research in CSE that contributes to basic science of
human\nlearning of complex problem solving. This goal is being achieved
through a set of community-building and
infrastructure\ncapacity-building activities whose ultimate goal is to
develop and disseminate infrastructure that facilitates\nthree aspects
of CSE research: \n\n\* development and broader re-use of innovative
learning content that is instrumented for rich data collection, \n\*
formats and tools for analysis of learner data,\n\* best practices to
make large collections of learner data and associated analytics
available to researchers in CSE, data science, or learning science.
\n\n\nWe engage a large community\nof researchers to define, develop,
and use critical elements of this infrastructure to address
specific\ndata-intensive research questions. We are hosting workshops,
meetings, and online forums leveraging\nexisting communities and
building new capacities toward significant research outcomes and
lasting\ninfrastructure support.\n\nThis is a collaborative project with
Carnegie Mellon University and Virginia Tech teams. \n\n== Current State
==\nThis community-building project has now been expanded into a
