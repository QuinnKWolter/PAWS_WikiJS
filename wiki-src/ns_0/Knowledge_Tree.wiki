== Overview ==\n[[Image:KnowledgeTreeLogo.gif|thumb|'''100'''|Knowledge Tree Logo]]\nKnowledge Tree is a link aggregating portal. It presents content structured according to the folder-document paradigm. Knowledge Tree provides authentication and authorization and implements a simplified form of access control. It supports collaborative authoring and social annotation. Knowledge Tree is primarily oriented towards [[ADAPT2|ADAPT<sup>2</sup>]] architecture.  \n\n'''Try Knowledge Tree''' by [http://adapt2.sis.pitt.edu/kt/register.html creating] a trial account.

The absolute majority of content on [[Knowledge Tree]] is educational, including a large body interactive exercises. Note-taking is one of the primary learning techniques in the paper-and-pencil world that we decided to build into [[Knowledge Tree]].\n\n[[Image:KnowledgeTree.notes.create.gif|thumb|'''100'''|Creating Notes in Knowledge Tree]]\nA note can be written for any 'node' (folder, document, linked resource) on [[Knowledge Tree]]. To create a note, one has to first open the desired folder, document, or resource in [[Knowledge Tree]] and in the top menu click on the 'bubble' icon ([[Image:KnowledgeTree.notes.menu_icon.png|20px]]). In the popped-up window one should then click on 'Create' link in the '''me''' section of the window. Note can be public or private, and, if public, signed or anonymous (right).\n\nIt is possible to edit already created note as well as view public notes your peers left that are displayed below your own note.\n\nWhen in the folder, folder items that have notes (yours or you peer's) have descriptive icons to the right of the item. Refer to table below for icons' explanations.\n\n{|border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"\n|+ '''Knowledge Tree inline note-related annotations'''\n!Icon\n!Description\n|-\n|[[Image:KnowledgeTree.notes.inline others1.png|34x20px]]\n|few of your peers have added notes\n|-\n|[[Image:KnowledgeTree.notes.inline others2.png|34x20px]]\n|more of your peers have added notes\n|-\n|[[Image:KnowledgeTree.notes.inline others3.png|34x20px]]\n|a lot of of your peers have added notes\n|-\n|[[Image:KnowledgeTree.notes.inline self others0.png|44x20px]]\n|you and none of your peers have added notes\n|-\n|[[Image:KnowledgeTree.notes.inline self others1.png|44x20px]]\n|you and few of your peers have added notes\n|-\n|[[Image:KnowledgeTree.notes.inline self others2.png|44x20px]]\n|you and more of your peers have added notes\n|-\n|[[Image:KnowledgeTree.notes.inline self others3.png|44x20px]]\n|you and a lot of of your peers have added notes\n|-\n|[[Image:KnowledgeTree.notes.inline more.png|20x20px]]\n|some items in this folder have notes\n|}\nWhen there are public notes from your peers, the actual number of them in given in brackets. If there are inline notes for the item you can view them by clicking on the icon and edit or even create your own notes.\n\n'''Example'''\n\n[[Image:KnowledgeTree.notes.inline example.png|81x20px]] - you and a lot of your peers (11 of them) wrote public notes to this folder, and there are notes to items inside this folder as well.\n\n== Standardization == \nKnowledge Tree structure is partially serialized as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework RDF].\nFor details to [[Knowledge Tree RDF Binding]].\n\n<onlyinclude>\n==See also==\n* [[Knowledge Tree RDF Binding]]\n* [[PERSEUS]]\n</onlyinclude>\n\n== Contacts ==\n[[User:Myudelson | Michael V.
