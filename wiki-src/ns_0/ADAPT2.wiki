== Overview ==\n[[Image:adapt2-arcitecture.gif|thumb|'''100'''|ADAPT<sup>2</sup> Architecture]]\n\n[[ADAPT2|ADAPT<sup>2</sup>]] (read adapt-square) - Advanced Distributed Architecture for Personalized Teaching and Training - is a framework for research on personalized and adaptive learning, which brings together researchers exploring novel types of interactive learning content with researchers exploring various kinds of personalization approaches. As a part of its mission, [[ADAPT2|ADAPT<sup>2</sup>]] currently provides personalized learning systems to support large classes for several computer science education topics such as Java, Python, and SQL. It has been used in many universities on four continents.\n\n[[ADAPT2|ADAPT<sup>2</sup>]] consists of the following principal component types.\n* Portals, such as [[Knowledge Tree]], which provide a single sign-on point for users of personalized learning systems\n* User-modeling servers such as[[CUMULATE]], which maintain knowledge models of individual students\n* Content Servers, which provide access to various kinds of interactive learning objects \n* Adaptive Shells, which offer various kinds of personalized access to learning objects\n* [[PERSEUS]] - personalization service engine\n\nTo provide personalized service to its end users, these components communicate with each other using several standard communication protocols. Two main groups of protocols are [[Content Invocation protocols]], which enable a portal or an adaptive shell to call interactive learning objects residing on various content servers, and [[CUMULATE protocol|User Modeling protocols]] for reporting user activities and requesting current state of their knowledge from user-modeling servers.\n\nA typical personalized learning system supported by [[ADAPT2|ADAPT<sup>2</sup>]] works in the following way:\n\n* Students log in through a portal, such as [[Knowledge Tree]] or a regular learning management system, which determines which courses (learning groups) they can access. To start learning, students choose one of these courses. \n* A selected course provides access to one or more adaptive shells, such as [[MasteryGrids]]. Each of these shells provides personalized access to multiple kinds of learning content made accessible for the course. The selected course also determines which student modeling server will be used for personalization.\n* Using the current state of the user models, which the adaptive shell requests from the user-modeling server, the shell helps each student find and launch an interactive learning object that is most appropriate for the current state of their knowledge. \n* While the students work with the selected interactive learning object, all their activities are reported back to the user-modeling server, which uses these activities to update the state of individual learners' knowledge.\n* After completing their work with each learning object, the students return to the adaptive shell, which now uses the updated state of the user model to assist the learners with selecting the next knowledge- and context-appropriate learning object.\n\nThe personalized learning process supported by [[ADAPT2|ADAPT<sup>2</sup>]] is quite typical for personalized learning. The difference made by [[ADAPT2|ADAPT<sup>2</sup>]] is the ability to integrate components developed by multiple research teams. A research team exploring specific kind of learning objects could release them in a new content server and re-use other components (portals, user-modeling servers, adaptive shells) to explore these objects in a realistic context along with other types of objects. A team that explores new approaches for user modeling or personalization could develop new types of user-modeling servers and adaptive shells and reuse components developed by other teams. [[ADAPT2|ADAPT<sup>2</sup>]] promotes collaboration and enables each team to focus on the type of learning technology that they want to explore.\n\nThe original design of the [[ADAPT2|ADAPT<sup>2</sup>]] architecture was presented in the following papers:\n* Brusilovsky, P. and Nijhawan, H.

(2004) Adaptive Hypermedia Services for E-Learning. In:  Proceedings of Workshop on Applying Adaptive Hypermedia Techniques to Service Oriented Environments at the Third International Conference on Adaptive Hypermedia and Adaptive Web-Based Systems (AH'2004), Eindhoven, the Netherlands, August 23, 2004, Technische University Eindhoven, pp. 470-479.\n\nOver the years, the infrastructure has been expanded with support of several projects such as [[Personalized Access to Open Corpus Educational Resources through Adaptive Navigation Support and Adaptive Visualization]] and [[Adaptive Navigation Support and Open Social Learner Modeling for PAL]]. We developed several adaptive shells to explore a range of personalization approaches and collaborated with many research teams to offer a broad set of interactive learning objects for computer science education. Currently, we are integrating [[ADAPT2|ADAPT<sup>2</sup>]] into a larger community-oriented infrastructure that is being developed by NSF-supported Infrastructure project [[Community-Building and Infrastructure Design for Data-Intensive Research in Computer Science Education]].\n\n== Knowledge Tree ==\n{|\n| valign="top" | [[Image:KnowledgeTreeLogo.gif|thumb|left|'''100'''|Knowledge Tree]]\n| valign="top" | [[Knowledge Tree]] is a link aggregating portal. It presents content structured according to the folder-document paradigm. [[Knowledge Tree]] provides authentication and authorization and implements a simplified form of access control. It supports collaborative authoring and social annotation. ([[Knowledge Tree|more]])\n|}\n\n== CUMULATE ==\n[[CUMULATE]] is a central user modeling server responsible for collecting evidence of user activity and for generating user models, i.e., assertions about the knowledge and mastery of individual users. Personalization components of the architecture, such as personalized shells and personalized learning content, could get access to the user models (using CUMULATE protocols) to offer personalized access and other personalized services to the end users. ==> ([[CUMULATE|more]] on CUMULATE)\n\n== Adaptive Shells ==\nADAPT2 supports multiple types of adaptive shells (aka value-adding services) which are the key components for providing adaptation and personalization. Adaptive shells stand between a portal and learning objects coming from multiple content servers. In contrast to the portal, which is not personalized, adaptive shells can provide personalized access to learning objects. The ability to insert various adaptive shells between the portal and the learning content makes possible to explore various personalization approaches. Examples of adaptive shells explored by our lab in the past include:\n* [[NavEx]] for concept-based personalization\n* [[QuizGuide]] and [JavaGUide]] for topic-based personalization\n* [[Knowledge Sea II]] for social navigation support\n* [[Progressor]] shells for a single-content social comparison\n* [[ProgressorPlus|Progressor+]] shell for multi-type social comparison\n\nSince 2015 most of our research uses [[MasteryGrids]] shell. [[MasteryGrids]] offers a flexible and customizable interface for delivering and exploring personalized content access. It combines knowledge-based personalization explored by [[NavEx]] and [[QuizGuide]] with social navigation and comparison ideas explored by [[Knowledge Sea II]], [[Progressor]], and [[ProgressorPlus|Progressor+]].\n\n== Content Servers ==\nContent servers provide learning objects for students to interact with. Content servers that natively work with [[ADAPT2|ADAPT<sup>2</sup>]] include several systems developed by PAWS lab: [[WebEx]], [[QuizPACK]], [[WADEIn|c/jWADEIn]], [[SQLKnoT]], [[QuizJET]], [[PCEX]].\nADAPT2 can also use learning objects developed by many other research teams. There are currently two ways to make interactive learning content usable in ADAPT2. \n* For unrestricted use, learning content server has to implement with [[ADAPT2|ADAPT<sup>2</sup>]] content invocation protocol and CUMULATE knowledge reporting protocols. Examples of of content servers that implement these protocols are [http://ictg.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz:8000/ SQL Tutor] (University of Canterbury, New Zealand), [https://mcs.utm.utoronto.ca/~pcrs/pcrs/ PCRS] (University of Toronto), and [[ACOS server]] (Aalto University).\n\n* For the use in [[MasteryGrids]] interface only, a learning content server has to implement [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_Tools_Interoperability LTI protocol] for launching learning activities and reporting learner progress. Examples of LTI-compatible learning content that are currently used in courses supported by [[ADAPT2|ADAPT<sup>2</sup>]] are [https://codeworkout.cs.vt.edu/ CodeWorkout] (Virginia Tech) and [https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3125659.3125688 DBQA] (University of St. Thomas).\n\n== ADAPT2 Protocols ==\n\nCommunication protocols enable multiple components of [[ADAPT2|ADAPT<sup>2</sup>]] to work together in a coordinated way. A new component could be easily integrated into the infrastructure as long as it communicates with other components using these standardized protocols.\nTwo main groups of [[ADAPT2|ADAPT<sup>2</sup>]] protocols are \n* [[Content Invocation protocols]], which enable a portal or an adaptive shell to call interactive learning objects residing on various content servers\n* [[CUMULATE protocol|User Modeling protocols]] for reporting user activities and requesting the current state of their knowledge from user-modeling servers.\n\n== PERSEUS ==\n[[Image:Perseus.gif|thumb|100px|PERSEUS]]\n[[PERSEUS]] is a Personalization Service Engine. It provides adaptive support for non-personalized (educational) hypermedia systems by abstracting content presentation/aggregation from user modeling. [[PERSEUS]] protocols are based on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rdf RDF] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_(file_format)#RSS_1.0 RSS 1.0]. Although, [[PERSEUS]] was initially developed for [[ADAPT2|ADAPT<sup>2</sup>]] framework, its data model permits seamless support of any other hypermedia application. Currently [[PERSEUS]] supports social navigation, topic-based navigation, concept-based navigation, and adaptive filtering techniques.\n\n==Standardization ==\nData models of [[ADAPT2|ADAPT<sup>2</sup>]] components are partially serialized as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework RDF].
