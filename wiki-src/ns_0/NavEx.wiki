= Overview =\n\nNavEx - Navigation to Examples - is a Web-based adaptive navigation tool for exploring programming examples. It serves as an adaptive shell for accessing [[WebEx]] examples.  NavEx uses concept indexing of code examples and provides three types of information to students.\n* What examples the student is ready to browse and what s/he is not.\n* What is the student's current progress.\n* What examples are the most relevant for the student.\n* Progress of the student with relation to the group.\n\n= Funding = \n[[Image:Nsf.gif|thumb|100px]]\nSystem development was currently supported by NSF ( [http://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?div=IIS Information & Intelligent Systems (IIS)] ) through [http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0447083 Award# 0447083]\n\n<small>Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation.</small>\n\n= Screenshots =\n<gallery perrow="3" widths="200">\nImage:NavEx.gif| [[NavEx]]\nImage:NavEx.gif| [[NavEx]]-SN (with Social Navigation)\n</gallery>\n\n= Try NavEx =\n* Try NavEx and other tools by registering at our [http://adapt2.sis.pitt.edu/cbum Community Porta]\n* Current users Login into [http://adapt2.sis.pitt.edu/portal_client/ Knowledge Tree porta]\n\n= Publications =\n<onlyinclude>\n* [[User:peterb|Brusilovsky, P.]], [[User:sergey|Sosnovsky, S.]], and [[User:myudelson|Yudelson, M.]] (2006) '''Addictive Links: The Motivational Value of Adaptive Link Annotation in Educational Hypermedia'''.
