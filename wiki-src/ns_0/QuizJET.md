## Overview

\nQuizJET is a system serves parameterized problems for self-assessment
of student knowledge of Java semantics (i.e., knowledge about how
various Java constructs are execured). QuizJET randomly generates a
question parameter, creates a presentation of the parameterized question
in a Web-based quiz, compares student's input to the correct answer
which QuizJET runs the parameterized code "behind the stage", and
records the results into a server-side database. There are several
assessment types deployed in QuizJET, including examining the final
value of the variable and the printouts etc. The quizzes and questions
can be authored through the unified Example Authoring interface, which
is also used in other projects within our research group. The
parameterized functionality inherits from

However, in order to cover more object-oriented programming concepts,
QuizJET integrates more comprehensive knowledge, such as object, classes
etc. There are three major designs in QuizJET differ from QuizPACK. 1)
the assessment domain knowledge is in Java. 2) the question is always
presented in the first tab page as the Driver Class. Imported classes
will be presented accordingly. 3) imported classes are not limited and
can be reused flexibly. QuizJET questions have been integrated in
several personalized systems such as
