This page is a tentative home for an anticipated workshop code-named "Architectures of Adaptive Hypermedia Systems" (working title). Its main purpose is to maintain awareness of the workshop organization process.\n\n== Choosing The Right Name And Focus ==\nMost recent first\n* Scalability And Infrastructure Issies Of User Adaptive And Cognitive Systems (Michael)\n** compromised abstract version, covers all important buzz-words (SIIUACS)\n* Framework/infrastructure issues in [distributed/component-based] adaptive hypermedia systems (Michael)\n** Infrastructure Issues In Adaptive Hypermedia Systems - IIIAHS - cool abbreviation :) [http://adapt2.sis.pitt.edu/wiki/Image:Iiiahs_ws_logo_ideas.png logo ideas]\n* Architectures and Approaches for Personalization and Adaptation (Eelco) - not just architectures, but also approaches to personalization\n* Architectures of [distributed] [component-based] personalized/user-adaptive systems  (Peter)\n* Architectures of Adaptive Hypermedia Systems - too restrictive?\n\n== Related Work ==\n* [http://aied2009.alelo.com Scalability Issues in AIED] Workshop at AIED 2009, Brighton, United Kingdom\n* [http://www.win.tue.nl/~mpechen/conf/dah09/ DAH’09]: International Workshop on Dynamic and Adaptive Hypertext: Generic Frameworks, Approaches \nand Techniques\n\n== Topics ==\nTo include (address, be aware, or relate to)\n* CMS and AS: striking the right balance while separating the two, ways to implement "hooks"/callbacks on CMS for connecting to AS\n* metadata for content: self-aware content (knows own metadata) vs. agnostic content\n* UM - AS: one-to-many and many-to-one\n** mapping/conversion/exchange of UMs\n** cross-system modeling\n** cross-domain generalization\n** standardizing UM representation\n* user interface considerations of AS\n** manifested UI (changing the UI) vs. hidden\n** scopes of most effective applicability of the two\n* framework/architecture/infrastructure implementation\n** ubiquity of infrastructure (extravert approach, third-party services) vs. utility (tradeoffs of introvert approach)\n** infrastructure "penetration" thresholds\n** existence of standards\n** applicability scopes of approaches\n* case studies and lessons learned\nNot to include\n* yet-another-[pseudo-]architecture\n\n== Vocabulary ==\n* content management system (CMS), aka Web CMS (WCMS) - users' entry point, the portal, the content aggregator\n* user model (UM), aka user modeling server/service (UMS)\n* adaptation service (AS), aka personalization service (PService), aka adaptive functionality (AF)\n* content, aka materials, aka resources\n* [domain] vocabulary, aka [domain] ontology - [structured] set of concepts, describing items of content\n* [content] metadata - [weighted] list of domain concepts describing content item\n\n== Host conference(s) ==\n[http://www.hawaii.edu/UMAP2010/ UMAP 2010]\n\n== Organization Committee ==\n* [http://www.l3s.de/~abel Abel, Fabian] (University of Hannover)\n* [http://www.l3s.de/~herder Herder, Eelco] (University of Hannover)\n* [http://www.pitt.edu/~mvy3 Yudelson, Michael] (University of Pittsburgh)\n\n== Program Committee (tentative) ==\n* [http://wwwis.win.tue.nl/~debra de Bra, Paul] (Technical University of Eindhoven)\n* [http://www.sis.pitt.edu/~peterb Brusilovsky, Peter] (University of Pittsburgh)\n* [https://www.cs.tcd.ie/Owen.Conlan/ Conlan, Owen] (Trinity College Dublin)\n* [http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/people/hcd Davis, Hugh] (University of Southampton)\n* [http://www.kbs.uni-hannover.de/~henze/ Henze, Nicola] (University of Hannover) - pending agreement\n* [https://www.cs.tcd.ie/Ian.OKeeffe O'Keeffe, Ian] (Trinity College Dublin)\n* [http://www.win.tue.nl/~eknutov/ Knutov, Evgeny] (Technical University of Eindhoven)\n* [https://www.cs.tcd.ie/~kkoidl Koidl, Kevin] (Trinity College Dublin)\n* [https://www.cs.tcd.ie/Vincent.Wade Wade, Vincent] (Trinity College Dublin)\n(and maybe more)\n\n== Contacts ==\n[[User:Myudelson|Michael Yudelson]]
