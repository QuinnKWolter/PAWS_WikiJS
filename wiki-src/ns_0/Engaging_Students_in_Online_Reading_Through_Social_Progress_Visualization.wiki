== Project Summary == \n\n[[Image:Readingcircle1.png|left|thumb|450px|Screenshot of [[ReadingCircle]], with reading material on the right side and the sunburst visualization on the left.]]\n\nAlmost every college course expects students to complete weekly readings from course textbooks or other kinds of course materials. Knowledge to be acquired during weekly reading assignment is critical for students’ course success. Yet, it is not easy for an instructor to assure that the student completed the assigned readings. Reading assignments produce no artifacts to grade. As a result, the students frequently have insufficient motivation to complete the reading assignments.  This project explores an alternative approach to encourage student reading using a social progress visualization interface [[ReadingCircle]].\n* student online reading process is tracked on the level of individual sections\n* student reading progress is visualized on several levels – from chapters to sections to subsections – and presented to the student\n* students are offered an interface to compare their reading progress with both, the progress of the class as a whole and the progress of individual peers\n\n== Funding ==\nThe project is funded by University of Pittsburgh [http://www.pitt.edu/~facaffs/acie/|Advisory Council on Instructional Excellence] in 2012.\n\n== Systems ==\n\n* [[ReadingCircle]]\n\n== Keywords ==\n\n[[ReadingCircle]], Social Comparison, [[Open Social Student Modeling]], OSSM, [[Social Navigation]], Online Reading, Electronic Textbook\n\n== More information ==\n\n* Watch [http://www.pitt.edu/~facaffs/acie/brusilovsky.html| project video]\n* Read [http://www.teachingkb.cidde.pitt.edu/teaching-times/school-of-information-sciences-encourages-online-reading-through-social-progress-visualization/| Teaching Times article]\n\n== Contacts ==\n[[User:julio | Julio Guerra]]\n\n[[User:Dparra | Denis Parra (past developer)]]\n\n== Publications == \n\nGuerra, J., Parra, D., and Brusilovsky, P.
