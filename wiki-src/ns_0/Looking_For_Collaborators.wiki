We are looking for collaborators who are interested in using PCLab in introductory Java/Python programming classes. PCLab is designed to help students to construct programs. It consists of programming examples and coding exercises for different topics in the introductory programming course.  \n\n== Videos == \n{|\n|valign="top" | [[Image:pclab.jpg|left|thumb|'''100'''|PCLab]]\n|valign="top" | The following videos introduce PCLab for Java/Python programming. \n* [http://bit.ly/pclab-java PCLab (Java)]\n* [http://bit.ly/pclab-python PCLab (Python)]\n|}\n\n== Mastery Grids Interface ==\n{|\n|valign="top" | [[Image:Mg_1.png|thumb|left|'''100'''|Mastery Grids Interface]]\n|valign="top" | PCLab presents examples and problems using Mastery Grids interface. Mastery Grids is both an innovative Open Social Learner Model Interface and an adaptive E-learning platform with integrated functionalities enabling multi-facet social comparison, open learner modeling, and adaptive navigation support to access multiple kinds of smart learning content. Mastery Grids is supported by adaptive social learning framework [[Aggregate]]. This framework supports several kinds of open student modeling, social comparison, and recommendation. In detail, Mastery Grids presents and compares user learning progress and knowledge level using colored grids, tracks user activities with learning content, and provides flexible user-centered navigation across different content levels (e.g. topic, question) and different content types (e.g. problem, example). Our past research shows that open student modeling and social comparison effectively increases students’ performance, motivation, engagement, and retention. \n\n* [[Mastery Grids Interface|More about Mastery Grids interface]]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76YLR2VY2QE YouTube demo of  Mastery Grids interface]\n* [http://adapt2.sis.pitt.edu/um-vis-dev2/index.html?usr=adl05&grp=ADL&sid=test&cid=13&data-top-n-grp=5&def-val-rep-lvl-id=p&def-val-res-id=AVG&ui-tbar-rep-lvl-vis=0&ui-tbar-topic-size-vis=0 An interactive demo of Mastery Grids interface]\n|}\n\n== Selected Publications ==\nThe following papers present sample of studies that we conducted using Mastery Grids in different programming classes.\n\n* Loboda, T., Guerra, J., Hosseini, R., and Brusilovsky, P.
