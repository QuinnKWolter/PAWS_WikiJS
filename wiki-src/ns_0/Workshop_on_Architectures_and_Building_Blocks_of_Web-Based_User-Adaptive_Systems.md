from small-scale stand-alone applications to interactive Web-based
applications that are often deployed on a larger scale. Consequently,
the need has arisen to move from prototypical systems to scalable,
deployable solutions. At the same time, a shift can be seen from
rule-based, mentalistic user modeling approaches to 'Web 2.0' approaches
that involve machine learning, data mining, and collaborative
techniques. \n\nPast research provided a large body of methods for
adaptation/personalization, and techniques for user modeling, usage
mining, and collaborative filtering. Conceptual frameworks splitting the
adaptation process into various layers provide guidance for implementing
user-adaptive systems. Based on these building blocks, various groups
have created their own frameworks, among others AHA!, APELS, and
Personal Reader. Framework design provides an opportunity to reuse
components or even whole layers of the adaptation process. Reuse of
components such as user behavior observation and logging tools, user
model storage promotes faster development, better feature selection, and
more robust systems.\n\nAlthough, system fragmentation enables component
reuse and speeds up the development of the new systems, there are
several issues. First, decomposition of a monolithic system should
result in a good abstraction of the data and process model to provide a
convenient basis for reuse. Second, the data traffic between the
separated system components may intensify. As the number of system users
increases issues related to scalability might arise. This is especially
true for user-adaptive and cognitive systems where the modeling and
personalization components are traditionally computationally and data
intensive. \n\nExisting work on the Web-based user-adaptive and
cognitive systems, including work on frameworks, shown that there exists
a strong overlap between conceptual models of the decomposed adaptation
process and the practical implications of its design. In this situation,
a logical step is to compare already working systems with emerging
approaches and models. In this workshop we seek to identify current
practices and experiences with concrete implementations of user-adaptive
and cognitive systems or specific components - varying from
experimental, small-scale prototypes to systems that are deployed on a
larger scale.\n\n=Topics=\nTopics include but are not limited to: \n\*
user behavior observation and user data collection: embedded into the
adaptive system or available as standalone components or add-ons, \n\*
user data management: data storage platforms and formats, the use of
open standards, querying techniques or APIs, interoperability issues,
\n\* reusing reasoning and adaptation techniques,\n\* scalability and
performance issues of user modeling and adaptation, \n\* generalizable
techniques for adaptation, personalization and recommendation, \n\*
translations of conceptual designs into concrete implementation, \n\*
deployment issues and lessons learned (case studies and
evaluation).\n\n=Proceedings=\nProceedings have been published at
