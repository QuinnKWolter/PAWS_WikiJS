Our group explores several kinds of information systems focused mostly
on personalized systems (such as adaptive learning and recommender
systems) and various kinds of systems that support human navigation in
information space (such as adaptive hypermedia and social navigation).
This page presents a brief overview of the types of systems we explore
and follows with a quick overview of the systems and frameworks
developed at <a href="Main_Page" class="wikilink" title="PAWS">PAWS</a>
lab.\nThis page presents the main types of topics and technologies
explored by PAWS Lab. Like other Wiki pages, it is permanently in
construction.\n\n= System Types =\n\n== Personalized Learning Systems
==\n\nPersonalized learning technologies provide an alternative to the
dominant “one-size-fits-all” approach to treating diverse student
audiences. While having a relatively long history, this research
direction moved to the forefront only recently when modern information
technologies opened new learning opportunities for a wide range of
students. Nowadays, personalized learning is considered to be a top
priority research direction by many experts. For example, [advanced
personalized
learning](http://www.engineeringchallenges.org/cms/8996/9127.aspx) was
named among [14 Grand Challenges for
Engineering](http://www.engineeringchallenges.org/) along with
preventing nuclear terror and making solar energy economical. It has
also been listed among the highest funding priorities in [Communications
of the
ACM](http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2010/2/69358-assessing-the-changing-us-it-rd-ecosystem/fulltext).\n\nPersonalized
learning technologies enable e-learning systems to maintain a model of
the goals, preferences and knowledge of each student and apply this
model to adapt the system performance to the student making the learning
process more efficient and enjoyable. In so doing, various kinds of
personalized e-learning systems demonstrated their ability to help
students acquire knowledge faster, improve learning outcomes, reduce
navigational overhead, and increase student engagement. Our team is
interested a range of personalized learning technologies, focusing on
modeling learner knowledge of the subject. Individual models of learner
knowledge that our systems maintain are used to guide learners to the
most appropriate learning content using course sequencing and adaptive
navigation support technologies. Some systems also use the models to
deliver adaptive visualization. Below is the list of personalized
learning systems developed by our group. Most of these systems are open
for anyone to use and explore online.\n\nMore at

for Computing Education ==\n\nTo support our research on personalized
learning, we developed several types of
<a href="Smart_Content" class="wikilink" title="Smart Content">Smart
Content</a> for Computing Education. Smart content engages students in
various kinds of interaction - exploration, simulation, problem
solving - and use a rich trace of learning data generated by students
interacting with this content to better model learner's knowledge. For
some types of smart content activities we have authoring and delivery
systems, other types are just collection of items, which you could use
but can't edit. An overview of our smart content types can found on the
<a href="Smart_Content" class="wikilink" title="Smart Content">Smart
