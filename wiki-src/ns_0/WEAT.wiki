The '''Worked Example Authoring Tool (WEAT)''' is an innovative tool designed to facilitate the creation of worked examples for programming education through a ''human-AI collaboration'' approach. By integrating ChatGPT, WEAT assists instructors in generating line-by-line explanations for code examples in Java and Python. Instructors can provide the code and problem statement, and WEAT uses ChatGPT to generate explanations for each line of code. These explanations can then be reviewed, edited, and added into the worked examples, streamlining the process of creating educational programming materials.\n \n== Try WEAT ==\n\n[http://adapt2.sis.pitt.edu/pcex-authoring/ <u>Click here</u>] to access the '''WEAT''', use your account credentials and login into the tool or create an account if you don't have one (''please send an email to Mohammad Hassany [[mailto:moh70@pitt.edu moh70@pitt.edu]] to activate your account'').\n\nPlease [https://youtu.be/IOfA0Ql3Zq0 <u>watch this video tutorial</u>] or read the [[WEAT_Tutorial|<u>user manual</u>]] to learn more about our tool.\n\n== WEAT Interface ==\n\n[[File:weat_image8.png|768px]]\n\nWorked Example Authoring Tool: Hub Page.\n\n== Publications ==\n* Hassany, M., Brusilovsky, P., Ke, J., Akhuseyinoglu, K., and Lekshmi Narayanan, A.
