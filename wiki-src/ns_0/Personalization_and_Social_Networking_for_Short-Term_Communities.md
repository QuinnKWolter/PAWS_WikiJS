## About the project

\nThis NSF-supported project aims to explore personalization and social
networking for short-term communities. Using academic research
conferences as a test bed, the project explored new methods to leverage
information about user interests (available from multiple external
resources) and develop techniques to facilitate use of existing social
technologies. In the course of the project we implemented and explored
Conference Navigator 3 along with a number of recommendation and
visualization approaches for it.\n\n== Systems
==\n\n<a href="CN3" class="wikilink" title="Conference Navigator 3">Conference
Navigator 3</a> is a social conference support system. It offers an
enhanced version of traditional tools: conference schedule and attendee
list. It combines social tagging and social navigation features, but
also use accumulated data from existing long-term communities (e.g.
Facebook, CiteULike, Mendeley) to help users to find the relevant
sessions to attend and to determine the appropriate people to make
contact with during the conference.

Navigator 3 is an EAGER (Early Concept Grants for Exploratory Research)
project. The project aims to explore personalization and social
networking for short-term communities. Using academic research
conferences as a test bed, the project will explore new methods to
leverage information about user interests (available from multiple
external resources) and develop techniques to facilitate use of existing
social technologies. \n\nA link to our system will be here by December
22th, 2010.\n\n**PI:** Associate Professor
