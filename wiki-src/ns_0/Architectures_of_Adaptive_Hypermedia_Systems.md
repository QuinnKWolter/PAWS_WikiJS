This page is a tentative home for an anticipated workshop code-named
"Architectures of Adaptive Hypermedia Systems" (working title). Its main
purpose is to maintain awareness of the workshop organization
process.\n\n== Choosing The Right Name And Focus ==\nMost recent
first\n\* Scalability And Infrastructure Issies Of User Adaptive And
Cognitive Systems (Michael)\n\*\* compromised abstract version, covers
all important buzz-words (SIIUACS)\n\* Framework/infrastructure issues
in \[distributed/component-based\] adaptive hypermedia systems
(Michael)\n\*\* Infrastructure Issues In Adaptive Hypermedia Systems -
IIIAHS - cool abbreviation :) [logo
ideas](http://adapt2.sis.pitt.edu/wiki/Image:Iiiahs_ws_logo_ideas.png)\n\*
Architectures and Approaches for Personalization and Adaptation
(Eelco) - not just architectures, but also approaches to
personalization\n\* Architectures of \[distributed\] \[component-based\]
personalized/user-adaptive systems (Peter)\n\* Architectures of Adaptive
Hypermedia Systems - too restrictive?\n\n== Related Work ==\n\*

2009, Brighton, United Kingdom\n\*
[DAH’09](http://www.win.tue.nl/~mpechen/conf/dah09/): International
Workshop on Dynamic and Adaptive Hypertext: Generic Frameworks,
Approaches \nand Techniques\n\n== Topics ==\nTo include (address, be
aware, or relate to)\n\* CMS and AS: striking the right balance while
separating the two, ways to implement "hooks"/callbacks on CMS for
connecting to AS\n\* metadata for content: self-aware content (knows own
metadata) vs. agnostic content\n\* UM - AS: one-to-many and
many-to-one\n\*\* mapping/conversion/exchange of UMs\n\*\* cross-system
modeling\n\*\* cross-domain generalization\n\*\* standardizing UM
representation\n\* user interface considerations of AS\n\*\* manifested
UI (changing the UI) vs. hidden\n\*\* scopes of most effective
applicability of the two\n\* framework/architecture/infrastructure
implementation\n\*\* ubiquity of infrastructure (extravert approach,
third-party services) vs. utility (tradeoffs of introvert
approach)\n\*\* infrastructure "penetration" thresholds\n\*\* existence
of standards\n\*\* applicability scopes of approaches\n\* case studies
and lessons learned\nNot to include\n\*
yet-another-\[pseudo-\]architecture\n\n== Vocabulary ==\n\* content
management system (CMS), aka Web CMS (WCMS) - users' entry point, the
portal, the content aggregator\n\* user model (UM), aka user modeling
server/service (UMS)\n\* adaptation service (AS), aka personalization
service (PService), aka adaptive functionality (AF)\n\* content, aka
materials, aka resources\n\* \[domain\] vocabulary, aka \[domain\]
ontology - \[structured\] set of concepts, describing items of
content\n\* \[content\] metadata - \[weighted\] list of domain concepts
describing content item\n\n== Host conference(s) ==\n[UMAP
