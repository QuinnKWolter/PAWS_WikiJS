Investigating and Scaffolding Students' Mental Models during Computer
Programming Tasks to Improve Learning, Engagement, and Retention

</h1>

\n\n== About the project ==\n\nThis project is a joint effort of
research teams at the University of Memphis and the University of
Pittsburgh to explore the process of code comprehension by students and
build a AI-based tools to support practice and assessment of code
comprehension. The project was funded by the National Science Foundation
by [Award
1822752](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1822752&HistoricalAwards=false)
between 2018 and 2023. In the course of the project, we developed and
evaluated open-learned modeling approaches, code-tracing tools to
practice code comprehension, and an intelligent tutor for assessing code
comprehension through explanations.\n\n== Motivation ==\nComputing
skills, such as computer programming, are an integral part of many
disciplines, including the fields of science, technology, engineering,
and math (STEM). Although such skills are in high demand, and the number
of aspiring Computer Science (CS) students is encouraging, a large gap
between the supply of CS graduates and the demand persists because, for
instance, college CS programs suffer from high attrition rates in
introductory CS courses. One reason for the high attrition rates in
introductory CS courses is the inherent complexity of CS concepts and
tasks. To help students better cope with the high level of complexity,
this project investigates a novel education technology, called CSEdPad
(CS Education Pad), meant to ease students' introduction to programming
during their early encounters with CS concepts and tasks. Moreover, the
project forges new frontiers in CS education through a research program
that advances our understanding of students' source code comprehension,
learning, and motivational processes. The CSEdPad project has the
potential to transform how students perceive computer science, increase
their programming skills and self-efficacy, and lead to increased
retention rates. The result will be a win-win-win situation for aspiring
students, CS programs and their organizations, and the overall
economy.\n\nThe CSEdPad system design brings to bear proven educational
technologies and techniques to improve students' mental model
construction, learning, engagement, and retention in CS education. In
particular, the system targets source code comprehension, a critical
skill for both learners and professionals. It monitors and scaffolds
source code comprehension processes while students engage in a variety
of code comprehension tasks. Key approaches being explored include
Animated Pedagogical Agents, self-explanation, and the Open Social
Learner Model. Outcome variables include comprehension measures,
learning gains, engagement level, retention, and self-efficacy. Due to
its interdisciplinary nature, the project will impact several fields
including Computer Science education, cognitive psychology, intelligent
tutoring systems, and artificial intelligence. Students participating in
the experiments will be selected from a diverse student body with
respect to gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. An increase in
recruitment and retention of students from these populations will have
far-reaching implications.\n\n== Teams == \n\n===University of
