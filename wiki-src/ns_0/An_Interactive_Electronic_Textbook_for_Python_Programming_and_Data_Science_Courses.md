Overview ==\nStudent reading content on a digital textbook platform or
online learning platform usually are distracted away from understanding
the details to specific programming examples or worked examples provided
in the textbook. This work explores the use of smart content allocation
at different sections / pages of the textbook covering concepts all and
only the concepts covered in the textbook upto that page / section while
leaving the examples with concepts that are covered later to be
allocated to a later section / page of the textbook.\n\n== Motivation
==\n\nThe goal of the work is two--fold: 1) allocating content that is
relevant to a specific page in terms of the concepts covered only up to
that page / section, 2) engaging students in the process of learning to
code or explore related examples related to the topic or concept.\n\n==
Preliminary Implementation ==\n\n\nIn this work we used 2 different
digital textbook platforms to allocate specific smart content that can
be loaded upto that point using the concepts covered in the
textbook.\n\nThe system uses 2 components:\n\n1. A python parser that
generates concepts for the examples presented in the book at that
page\n\n2. The same parser is used to generate concepts for all the
smart content available in the systems at PAWS Lab -- [refer "Smart
Learning Content for Computing
Education"](http://adapt2.sis.pitt.edu/wiki/Systems)\n\n3. The smart
content as a list of links in the tab on the side of the page for
students to load and view.\n\n== Added Smart Content == \n\n![ 170px
