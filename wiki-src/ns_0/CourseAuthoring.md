The **Course Authoring Tool** is designed to simplify the process of
course creation for instructors. This tool allows instructors to
efficiently organize and bundle smart content from multiple providers
into structured units or modules, which can be seamlessly integrated
into LMS such as Canvas. Additional features include the ability to
explore and clone publicly shared course structures, create new courses
from scratch, and facilitate sharing and reuse of course materials.\n
