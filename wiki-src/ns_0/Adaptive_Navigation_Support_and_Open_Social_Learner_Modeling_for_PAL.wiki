== Overview ==\n\nThe goal of this project is to leverage the power of [[open social learner modeling]] and [[adaptive navigation support]] in the context of the envisioned Personalized Assistant for Learning (PAL). The project is supported by the [http://adlnet.gov  Advanced Distributed Learning Initiative] contract W911QY13C0032. This is a joint project with [http://cs.aalto.fi/en/research/ Learning + Technology] research group at Aalto University. The LeTech group at Aalto University focuses on developing several kinds of [http://acos.cs.hut.fi/ smart learning content for Java and Python programming] that are compatible with the project architecture [[Aggregate]].\n\nThe project focuses on both exploration and implementation of adaptive navigation support and open social learner modeling and pursues three directions of work:\n\n* Exploring open social learner modeling interface for diverse learning content\n* Enhancing algorithms for personalized guidance using knowledge-based and social approaches \n* Developing architectural solutions and authoring tools to support open social learner modeling\n\nWe have prepared fliers for quickly getting to know our systems:\n* For researchers or system developers (designers), please check [[Media:MGFlier.pdf|here]].\n* For teachers or educators, please check the flier for your interested domain: [[Media:MasteryGridsFlierJava.pdf|Java]], [[Media:MasteryGridsFlierPythonNew.pdf|Python]], or [[Media:MasteryGridsFlierSQL.pdf|SQL]].\n\n== Open Social Learner Model Interface: Mastery Grids ==\n\n{|\n|valign="top" | [[Image:Mg_1.png|thumb|left|'''100'''|Mastery Grids Interface]]\n|valign="top" | [[Mastery Grids Interface|Mastery Grids]] is a flexible portal to access multiple types of learning content through a personalized interface based on Open Social Learner Modeling (OSLM) [[Mastery Grids Interface]]. It offers a multi-facet social comparison, open learner modeling, and adaptive navigation support to help students  access multiple kinds of smart learning content. With Mastery Grids, instructors could re-use one of the existing installations (see below) or create their own installations by organizing their courses info a sequence of topics and selecting most relevant smart content items of multiple types for each topic. There is a drag-and-drop authoring system to support instructors in creating their own courses.\n\nMastery Grids is based on communication-based personalization infrastructure ADAPT2 (formerly Knowledge Tree) and supported by adaptive social learning framework [[Aggregate]]. ADAPT2 supports smart content invocation with single sign-on, extensive data collection, and student modeling. Aggregate adds several kinds of open student modeling, social comparison, and recommendation. In detail, Mastery Grids presents and compares user learning progress and knowledge level using colored grids, tracks user activities with learning content, and provides flexible user-centered navigation across different content levels (e.g. topic, question) and different content types (e.g. problem, example)\n\n* [[Mastery Grids Interface|More about Mastery Grids interface]]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76YLR2VY2QE YouTube demo of  Mastery Grids interface]\n* [http://adapt2.sis.pitt.edu/um-vis-adl/index.html?usr=adl01&grp=ADL&sid=test&cid=13&data-top-n-grp=5&def-val-rep-lvl-id=p&def-val-res-id=AVG&ui-tbar-rep-lvl-vis=0&ui-tbar-topic-size-vis=0 An interactive demo of Mastery Grids interface]\n|}\n\n== Architecture: Aggregate==\n{|\n|valign="top" | [[Image:arch_v2.png|thumb|left|'''100'''|Aggregate Architecture]]\n|valign="top" | We developed an adaptive social learning architecture [[Aggregate]] to support Mastery Grids interface. [[Aggregate]] is an extension of our original [[ADAPT2]] architecture. On the top of  [[ADAPT2]] , [[Aggregate]] architecture supports several kinds of open student modeling, social comparison, content brokering, and recommendation services. The architecture fulfills a major objective, portability, which is the ability to be integrated to other systems with little set up and modification. The architecture is modular and includes different software components. \n\n* [[ADAPT2| More about ADAPT2]]\n* [[Aggregate| More about Aggregate]]\n|}\n\n== Learner Modeling ==\n{|\n|valign="top" | [[Image:CUMULATE.evidence propagation.png|thumb|left|'''100'''|CUMULATE]]\n|valign="center" | We have developed [[CUMULATE]], a centralized user modeling server built for the [[ADAPT2]] architecture, to provide user modeling support for adaptive educational hypermedia (AEH) systems. CUMULATE allows flexible learner models to infer learner knowledge. Mastery Grids's architecture is supported by CUMULATE and thus it also supports flexible learner models. The explanation of the communication between the interface and learner model can be found in [[Aggregate]]. We have proposed and implemented different learner models over past years, including [[CUMULATE asymptotic knowledge assessment|asymptotic assessment of user knowledge]] which is the main one currently deployed in our systems, and [[Feature-Aware Student knowledge Tracing (FAST)|Feature-Aware Student knowledge Tracing (FAST)]] which is our new learner model proposed in 2014 with state-of-the-art predictive performance. We have also explored different aspects to improve learner modeling, including reducing the content model, better evaluation for practitioners and applying network (graph) analysis.\n\n* [[Learner Modeling|More about Learner Modeling]]\n* [[CUMULATE|More about CUMULATE]]\n* [[CUMULATE asymptotic knowledge assessment|More about asymptotic assessment of user knowledge]]\n* [[Feature-Aware Student knowledge Tracing (FAST)|More about Feature-Aware Student knowledge Tracing (FAST)]]\n|}\n\n== Recommendation ==\n{|\n|valign="top" | [[Image:starRecommendation.png|thumb|left|'''100'''|Personalization]]\n|valign="top" | There are multiple personalization approaches, that are developed and researched in our system. In the form of recommendations, we have various methods in different levels for recommending learning material to students. Two major approached for recommending resources are reactive and proactive recommendations. In the reactive approach, the recommender system activates in reaction to the student's activity, e.g. if the student fails in solving a quiz, the reactive recommender system recommends related examples to this student to help her understand the skills required to solve that quiz. The pro-active recommender system, proactively suggests learning materials to the students. [[Learning Recommendation|==> more]]\n\n\n|}\n\n== Educational Data Mining ==\n{|\n|valign="top" | [[Image:TensorFactorization.png|thumb|left|'''100'''|Educational Data Mining]]\n|valign="top" | In this part of the project, we aim to make sense of data from Mastery Grids system, including logs of student attempts. The goal in this part includes understanding students' learning patterns and its relationship with students' behavioral traits, predicting students' performance, modeling student knowledge, and discovering the content model. These tasks eventually help us in providing a better service to both instructors and students.  [[Educational Data Mining|==> more]]\n\n\n|}\n\n== Smart Content ==\n{|\n|valign="top" | [[Image:AnimatedExamples.jpg|thumb|left|'''100'''|Smart Content (Animated Examples)]]\n|valign="top" | Mastery Grids supports and provides multiple types of learning materials. It has been applied in three domains (Java, SQL, and Python) as a supplementary E-learning system for undergraduate and graduate level programming and database classes since 2013. We have developed different content applications (e.g., [[QuizJET]], [[QuizPET]], [[WebEx]]) and authoring tools (e.g., [[Content Authoring Tools]], [[Course Authoring Tool]], [[Group Authoring Tool]]) for accessing and authoring such contents. In each learning domain, courses are organized by topics and different types of learning contents are arranged under each topic. Learning contents contain problems (quizzes), parson problems, annotated examples, and animated examples collected from experienced course teachers, textbooks or domain experts. [[Smart Content|==> more]]\n|}\n\n== Authoring Tools ==\n{|\n|valign="top" |  [[Image:ExampleAuthoringModify.jpg|thumb|left|'''100'''|Annotated Example Content Authoring]]\n|valign="top" | We have developed four major types of authoring tools for the project: 1) Content Authoring Tools for creating different kinds of smart learning content, 2) Course Authoring Tool for creating adaptive courses that use the content, 3) Group Authoring Tool for managing users and groups, as well as 4) the portal to access different authoring tools. \n\n* [[Authoring Tools|More about Authoring Tools]]\n* [[Content Authoring Tools|More about Content Authoring Tools]]\n* [[Course Authoring Tool|More about Course Authoring Tool]]\n* [[Group Authoring Tool|More about Group Authoring Tool]]\n* [[Authoring Tool Portal|More about Authoring Tool Portal]]\n|}\n\n== Open Source  == \nSoftware sources and documentations are in GitHub [https://github.com/PAWSLabUniversityOfPittsburgh PAWSLabUniversityOfPittsburgh organization], and [https://github.com/acos-server/ acos-server organization].\n* The Mastery Grids Interface, back-end Aggregate and documentation can be found [https://github.com/PAWSLabUniversityOfPittsburgh/mastery-grids here]. \n* User model services can be found in [https://github.com/PAWSLabUniversityOfPittsburgh/AggregateUMServices here].\n* QuizJET Interface, Authoring Tool, Content Brokering and documentations can be found [https://github.com/PAWSLabUniversityOfPittsburgh/quizjet here].\n* QuizPET Interface, Authoring Tool, Content Brokering and documentations can be found [https://github.com/PAWSLabUniversityOfPittsburgh/quizpet here].\n* Parson Problem Authoring Tool can be found [https://github.com/acos-server/acos-jsparsons-generator here].\n* Annotated Examples Interface, Authoring Tool, Content Brokering and documentations can be found [https://github.com/PAWSLabUniversityOfPittsburgh/annotated-examples here].\n* Animated Examples Authoring Tool can be found [https://github.com/acos-server/acos-jsvee-transpiler-python here].\n* Videos User Interface, Authoring Tool, Content Brokering and documentations can be found [https://github.com/PAWSLabUniversityOfPittsburgh/educvideos here]\n\n== Publications ==\n* Gonzalez-Brenes, J.
