Feature-Aware Student knowledge Tracing (FAST) is a novel, efficient
student model created by PAWs lab and Pearson with the state-of-the-art
predictive performance. It allows general, flexible features into
[Knowledge
Tracing](http://liris.cnrs.fr/~pchampin/2014/m2iade-ia2/_static/893CorbettAnderson1995.pdf),
which is the most popular student model. For the first time it unifies
existed specially designed student models based on Knowledge Tracing
framework with integrated advantages. We demonstrate FAST’s flexibility
with examples of feature sets that are relevant to a wide audience: we
haved uses features in FAST to model (i) multiple subskills, (ii)
temporal Item Response Theory, and (iii) expert knowledge. Compared with
Knowledge Tracing, (1) it improves up to 25% in classification
performance, (2) it generates more interpretable, consistent parameters,
and (3) it is 300 times faster. In a [follow-up
study](http://adenu.ia.uned.es/workshops/pale2014/pale2014_proceedings_vol1181.pdf#page=9),
we compared FAST to the best paper model (a single-purpose model) of the
same year with favorable results while FAST is designed as a
general-purpose model. The [main

was nominated for the Best Paper Award in a top-tier conference in 2014.
Both the main and the follow-up papers were cited by top researchers in
the field from Carnegie Mellon University, Stanford, Cornell, ETH Zurich
(etc.) with in total 34 citations since 2014 (till 04/2016). \n\n==
