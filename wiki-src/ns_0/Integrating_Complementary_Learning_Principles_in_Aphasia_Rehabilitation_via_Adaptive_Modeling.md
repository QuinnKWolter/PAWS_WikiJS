is a language disorder commonly caused by stroke and other acquired
brain injuries that affects over two million people in the US and has a
large negative effect on quality of life. Anomia (i.e., word-finding
difficulty) is a primary frustration for people with aphasia, and naming
treatments for anomia are both widely researched and commonly used in
clinical practice. For naming treatments to make a meaningful impact on
the lives of people with aphasia, they must produce durable gains in
word-finding which generalize beyond the treatment context. However,
most theoretically-motivated naming treatment research fails to address
the long- term retention of trained words and their generalization to
connected speech, limiting their clinical impact. Prevailing learning
theory suggests that “desirable difficulty” improves treatment retention
and generalization. The current proposal therefore seeks to improve the
durability and context generalization of computer-based naming treatment
by incorporating model-based algorithms to adaptively maintain desirable
difficulty. We will test two distinct models in parallel clinical
trials. Our central premise is that these models will facilitate a
balance between what have historically been framed as contrasting
learning approaches: errorless learning vs. effortful retrieval
(Study 1) and massed vs. distributed practice (Study 2). Instead, our
models will integrate these approaches by replacing extreme static
contrasts with continuous task components which can be adaptively
modified based on ongoing patient performance. Study 1 will adaptively
balance effort and accuracy using speeded naming deadlines based on a
model we have developed which characterizes individuals’ speed-accuracy
tradeoffs in picture naming over time. Study 2 will manipulate trial
spacing using an adaptive scheduling and memory decay model built into
widely available, open-source flashcard software. In both studies, we
predict that when compared to matched traditional non-adaptive treatment
conditions, our adaptive conditions will produce more successful
retention of trained words 3 and 6 months post-treatment on naming
probes (Aims 1a, 2a), and better context generalization to connected
speech when tested on complex scene descriptions containing untrained
exemplars of trained words (Aims 1b, 2b). We also predict that adaptive
trial spacing in Study 2 will successfully train many more words than is
possible in current standard care. In addition, data generated in
Studies 1 and 2 will be used to develop the next generation of adaptive
timing models (Aims 1c and 2c), spurring future innovations in
personalized medicine. Successful clinical trial outcomes will
demonstrate that adaptive computer-based naming treatments provide a
novel way to produce large, durable, and generalizable treatment gains,
and positive Study 2 findings could be immediately implemented in
clinical practice at scale using free open-source software. Successful
modeling outcomes will lead to even more effective interventions and lay
the groundwork for a transformative research agenda that could
ultimately lead to comprehensive adaptive learning systems for aphasia
rehabilitation.
