support from National Science Foundation and the School of Information
Sciences at the University of Pittsburgh. The goal of the PAWS Lab is
development and evaluation of innovative user- and group-adaptive
Web-based technologies, systems, and architectures. The Lab currently
explores a range of user modeling, adaptation and personalization
technologies. The work of the Lab is supported by NSF and NIH
