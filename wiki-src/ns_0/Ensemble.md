<a href="Ensemble" class="wikilink" title="Ensemble">Ensemble</a> is an
NSF NSDL Pathways project working to establish a national, distributed
digital library for computing education. Our project is building a
distributed portal providing access to a broad range of existing
educational resources for computing while preserving the collections and
their associated curation processes. We want to encourage contribution,
use, reuse, review and evaluation of educational materials at multiple
levels of granularity and we seek to support the full range of computing
education communities including computer science, computer engineering,
software engineering, information science, information systems and
information technology as well as other areas often called “computing +
X” or “X informatics.”\n\n= See also =\n\* Ensemble portal
