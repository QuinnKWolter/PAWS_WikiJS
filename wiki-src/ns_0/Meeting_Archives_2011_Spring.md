# 2011 Spring

\n**Meeting Time:** Tuesday 3pm-4:30pm\n  
**Location:** IS502  
\n\n==January==\n\n=== 2011-01-18 ===\nWe had a guest lecture by Roman
Bednarik, who was a visiting scholar in our Lab some years ago and know
has come back has a visiting researcher. He introduced his research in
the areas of Eye-tracking methodology, Eye-movement biometrics, and
Program Visualization.\n\n=== 2011-01-25 ===\nWe had 2 guest lectures of

popular and Identity Clone Attacks (ICAs) that aim at creating fake
identities for malicious purposes on OSNs are becoming a significantly
growing concern. Such attacks severely affect the trust relationships a
victim has built with other users if no active protection is applied. In
this paper, we first analyze and characterize the behaviors of ICAs.
Then we propose a detection framework that is focused on discovering
suspicious identities and then validating them. Towards detecting
suspicious identities, we propose two approaches based on attribute
similarity and similarity of friend networks. The first approach
addresses a simpler scenario where mutual friends in friend networks are
considered; and the second one captures the scenario where similar
friend identities are involved. We also present experimental results to
demonstrate flexibility and effectiveness of the proposed approaches.
Finally, we discuss some feasible solutions to validate suspicious
identities.\n\|-\n\|}\n\n\n\* Patrick Dudas\n\n{\| style="border: 1px

intuitive ideology that provides an intelligent self-motivating
mechanism that guides researchers to unknown yet important pieces or
places of new information. Combining this and the developed
visualization lends itself to a novel platform of discovery. Provided is
a description of the application of social navigation and its adaption
to 2D and 3D genomic interactive, cooperative visualizations. This is
then tested with a front-end analysis and usability study to find
synergy between the two designs and validate a visualization that is
collaborative, interactive and instinctual to navigate these 2D and 3D
genomic visualizations based on user’s
annotations.\n\|-\n\|}\n\n==February==\n\n=== 2011-02-1 ===\n\*

2.0**:\nIn this presentation, we introduce our preliminary studies on
using online social community based data for scholarly communication
studies. First, we compare academic information in CiteULike with a
traditional citation analysis dataset (using Web of Knowledge academic
articles) from perspectives of articles, scholars (authors&users), and
publications (journals/conferences). Second, we present preliminary
results of using CiteULike scholarly communication data on two major
scientometrics applications: evaluation of scholarly impacts, and
clustering of academic resources.\n\|-\n\|}\n\n\* Sherry\n{\|
