[[WebEx]] is a system that serves dissected examples - [[#dissection|dissections]]. Each dissection is a sequence of [[#line|lines]] that have [[#annotation|annotations]] associated with them. [[#dissection|Dissections]] are grouped into collections - [[#scope|scopes]]. The natural domain of WebEx is programming. However, other applications are also possible, e.g. poetry.\n\nHere are two examples from WebEx:\n\n[[Image:AnnotatedExamples.jpg|750x1000px]]\n\n== Relevant Links ==\n[[WebEx RDF Binding]]
