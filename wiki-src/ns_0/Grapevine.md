Finding a suitable research advisor is a significant challenge for
undergraduate students, especially for those who are new to the
intricacies of academic research. Grapevine addresses this challenge by
offering a tailored system that simplifies the process of matching
students with research advisors. It's particularly beneficial for
first-generation college students who may not have prior exposure to
navigating academic environments. Grapevine's aim is to facilitate these
students' entry into the research domain, providing a supportive tool to
identify advisors whose interests align with their own.\n\n

\n\n\n\nThe interface of Grapevine, illustrated in Figure 1, is
user-centric and intuitive. It features a search box, a list of
suggested keywords, sliders for adjusting research interests, and a
display of potential advisors. This design enables students to actively
engage in refining their research preferences, helping them to clarify
and articulate their interests more effectively. Detailed advisor
profiles, as seen in Figure 2, offer in-depth information about each
advisor’s research areas, assisting students in making informed
decisions. The system's underlying knowledge graph, shown in Figure 3,
links advisors, research topics, and keywords to generate personalized
recommendations, adapting to each student's evolving research
interests.\n\n

\n\nIn essence, Grapevine serves as a practical and accessible platform
for undergraduate students embarking on their research journeys. It's
designed to demystify the process of finding a research advisor, making
it more approachable and aligned with individual student needs. By
leveraging technology to connect students with compatible advisors,
Grapevine hopes to contribute to creating a supportive environment for
the next generation of researchers.\n\n
