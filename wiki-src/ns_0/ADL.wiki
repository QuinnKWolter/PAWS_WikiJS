== Description ==\nPAWS participation in ADL is focused in the development of MasteryGrids system. Mastery Grids is a visual-rich, interactive, adaptive E-learning platform with integrated functionalities enabling multi-facet social comparison, open user modeling, and multi-type learning materials support. It presents and compares user learning progress and knowledge level (mastery) by colored grids, tracks user activities and feedbacks dynamically and provides flexible user-centered navigation across different content levels (e.g. topic, question) and different content types (e.g. question, example) of learning materials.\nThe architecture supporting Mastery Grids fulfills a major objective, portability, which is the ability to be integrated to other systems with little set up and modification. The architecture is modular and includes different software components:\n\n*frontend user-system interaction interface, the [[Mastery Grids Interface]],\n\n*backend '''''Aggregate''''' services communicating between the main interface and user modeling services,\n\n*backend user modeling services, and\n\n*backend content providing applications.\n\nAn overall architecture of the system can be sen in the next figure. \n\n[[Image:architecture_v1.png]]\n\n== Systems ==\n\n=== Mastery Grids ===\n[[MasteryGrids|More]]\n\n=== Aggregate ===\n[[Aggregate|More]]\n\n== Learning Content ==\n\n== Authoring Tools == \n==== Content Authoring ====\nThis tool provides the interface for teachers to create and index annotated examples.
