Our group explores several kinds of information systems focused mostly on personalized systems (such as adaptive learning and recommender systems) and various kinds of systems that support human navigation in information space (such as adaptive hypermedia and social navigation). This page presents a brief overview of the types of systems we explore and follows with a quick overview of the systems and frameworks developed at [[Main Page|PAWS]] lab.\nThis page presents the main types of topics and technologies explored by PAWS Lab. Like other Wiki pages, it is permanently in construction.\n\n= System Types =\n\n== Personalized Learning Systems ==\n\nPersonalized learning technologies provide an alternative to the dominant “one-size-fits-all” approach to treating diverse student audiences. While having a relatively long history, this research direction moved to the forefront only recently when modern information technologies opened new learning opportunities for a wide range of students. Nowadays, personalized learning is considered to be a top priority research direction by many experts. For example, [http://www.engineeringchallenges.org/cms/8996/9127.aspx advanced personalized learning] was named among [http://www.engineeringchallenges.org/ 14 Grand Challenges for Engineering] along with preventing nuclear terror and making solar energy economical. It has also been listed among the highest funding priorities in [http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2010/2/69358-assessing-the-changing-us-it-rd-ecosystem/fulltext Communications of the ACM].\n\nPersonalized learning technologies enable e-learning systems to maintain a model of the goals, preferences and knowledge of each student and apply this model to adapt the system performance to the student making the learning process more efficient and enjoyable. In so doing, various kinds of personalized e-learning systems demonstrated their ability to help students acquire knowledge faster, improve learning outcomes, reduce navigational overhead, and increase student engagement. Our team is interested a range of personalized learning technologies, focusing on modeling learner knowledge of the subject. Individual models of learner knowledge that our systems maintain are used to guide learners to the most appropriate learning content using course sequencing and adaptive navigation support technologies. Some systems also use the models to deliver adaptive visualization. Below is the list of personalized learning systems developed by our group. Most of these systems are open for anyone to use and explore online.\n\nMore at [[Personalized Learning Systems]]\n\nSystems:\n* [[QuizGuide]]\n* [[NavEx]]\n* [[Database Exploratorium]]\n* [[KnowledgeZoom]]\n* [[MasteryGrids]]\n* [[Mastery_Grids_Interface]] \n* [[JavaGuide]]\n* [[Progressor]]\n* [[ProgressorPlus]]\n\n== Smart Learning Content for Computing Education ==\n\nTo support our research on personalized learning, we developed several types of [[Smart Content]] for Computing Education. Smart content engages students in various kinds of interaction - exploration, simulation, problem solving - and use a rich trace of learning data generated by students interacting with this content to better model learner's knowledge. For some types of smart content activities we have authoring and delivery systems, other types are just collection of items, which you could use but can't edit. An overview of our smart content types can found on the [[Smart Content]] page.
