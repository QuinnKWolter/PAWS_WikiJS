Ordinarily [[CUMULATE]]'s considers them separately by classifying them to modeling tiers or levels, each corresponding to a level of [http://www.officeport.com/edu/blooms.htm| Bloom's taxonomy] of intellectual behavior. Great part of this work is devoted on cross-tier user modeling. Namely, how user activity can (positively) influence on another/other layer(s).\n\n== Study 1 ==\nIn this study we have inspected the influence of the comprehension layer of [[CUMULATE]]'s user model (viewing examples) on the application layer (solving problems). Our approach was to create "blends" of problem-solving tier of the user model and weighted (from 0 to 1, with .1 step) example viewing tier Our hypotheses were that:\n* Using example browsing activity when modeling problem solving improves model accuracy\n* Different users benefit from different “blends” of user model levels\nIn addition we wanted to se if\n* There is a single optimal blend for all users, and. or\n* Classes of users benefitting from different model blends can be determined\n\n=== Data ===\nWe were using previously collected student [[CUMULATE_Usage_Logs#Database_Management_6_Course_Dataset|usage logs]] collected from 4 Database Management courses offered during Fall 2007 and Spring 2008 semesters at the [http://www.pitt.edu University of Pittsburgh] and [http://www.dcu.ie Dublin City University]. Each course had roughly the same structure, an identical set of 48 problems served by [[SQLKnoT]] system, and an identical set of 64 examples served by [[WebEx]] system. Basic usage statistics are given in the table below.\n\n{|  border="1"\n!School\n!Semester\n!Level\n!No. of users\n!Avg. problem attempts\n!Avg. example views\n!Avg. distinct problems\n!Avg. distinct examples\n|- \n| U. of Pitt\n| Fall 2007\n| U*\n| 27\n| 156.40\n| 189.00\n| 29.96\n| 32.07\n|- \n| U. of Pitt\n| Fall 2007\n| G\n| 20\n| 61.70\n| 104.70\n| 29.95\n| 29.10\n|- \n| U. of Pitt\n| Spring 2008\n| U\n| 15\n| 26.94\n| 46.65\n| 16.35\n| 10.29\n|- \n| DCU\n| Spring 2008\n| U\n| 52\n| 81.68\n| 257.25\n| 22.82\n| 38.63\n|}\n* U – undergraduate, G – graduate\n\n=== Procedures ===\nOut of 114 users who took the class 56 were chosen. The criteria was that the user had to cover at least 33% of problems (15/48) and at least 33% of examples (15/64). For each of the qualified users 11 user models were computed: with 0% to 100% of example browsing activity "blended" to the problem solving (by % here we mean numerical weighting not item filtering).\n\n=== Metrics ===\n* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy Accuracy] was used to measure the resulting user model quality\n* For every user - the "best blend" - blended model (with 10% or more of example activity added) having the highest accuracy; if there is more than one such model, the smallest % of the blend is taken\n* For each user - number of "best blends" - number of blended models (with 10% blend of example activity or more), where the accuracy is the highest\n\n=== Results ===\n[[Image:Blending layers of CUMULATE's user model.

Study 1.histogram.png|thumb|'''100'''|Distribution of number of users for different "best" blends]]\n* While looking at users' individual preferences, the best user blend seems to be superior to the 0%-blend: t = -5.38, p-value<.001\n* Comparison of uniform blends for all users to a 0%-blends, shows that 40% and 50% blends were significantly better than 0%-blend: t = -for both 2.05, p-value = .023\n* User separation into groups by the number of best blends yielded the following results\n** <span style="color:grey;">'''''Low'''''. 1 best blend only, 2 users. No further investigation performed.</span>\n** '''''Medium'''''. 2-4 best blends. 22 users. Here 90% blend had the highest significant edge over 0% blend: p-value = .037\n** '''''High'''''. 5-9 best blends. 17 users. This group follows the global trend with 40% and 50% blends having best significant edge over 0% blend: p-value = .049\n** <span style="color:grey;">'''''No difference'''''. 10 best blends (all blended models have same accuracy). 15 users.
