Hsiao</a> Thesis Defence: [Navigation Support and Social Visualization
for Personalized E-Learning](http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/13439/)
====\nA large number of educational resources is now made available on
the Web to support both regular classroom learning and online learning.
However, the abundance of available content produced at least two
problems: how to help students to find the most appropriate resources
and how to engage them into using these resources and benefit from them.
Personalized and social learning have been suggested as potential ways
to address these problems.\n\nThis work attempts to combine the ideas of
personalized and social learning by providing navigation support through
an open social student modeling visualization. A series of classroom
studies exploited the idea of the approach and revealed promising
results, which demonstrated the personalized guidance and social
visualization combined helped students to find the most relevant
resources of parameterized self-assessment questions for Java
programming. Thus, this dissertation extend the approach to a larger
collection of learning objects for cross content navigation and verify
its capability of supporting social visualization for personalized
E-Learning.\n\nThe study results confirm that working with the
non-mandatory system, students enhanced the learning quality in
increasing their motivation and engagement. They successfully achieved
better learning results. Meanwhile, incorporating a mixed collection of
content in the open social student modeling visualizations effectively
led the students to work at the right level of questions. Both strong
and weak student worked with the appropriate levels of questions for
their readiness accordingly and yielded a consistent performance across
all three levels of complexities. Additionally, providing a more
realistic content collection on the navigation supported open social
student modeling visualizations results in a uniform performance in the
group. The classroom study revealed a clear pattern of social guidance,
where the stronger students left the traces for weaker ones to follow.
The subjective evaluation confirms the design of the interface in terms
of the content organization. Students’ positive responses also
compliment the objective system usage data.\n\ndownload it from

<a href="User:Sergey" class="wikilink" title=" Sergey Sosnovsky"> Sergey
Sosnovsky</a> Thesis Defence: Ontology-Based Open-Corpus Personalization
for E-Learning ====\nConventional closed-corpus adaptive information
systems control limited sets of documents in fixed subject domains and
cannot provide access to the content outside the system. Such
restrictions contradict the requirements of today, when most of the
information systems are implemented in the open document space of WWW
and are expected to operate on the open-corpus content. In order to
maintain personalized access to open-corpus documents, an adaptive
system should be able to model the documents and the relations between
the documents and the domain knowledge automatically and dynamically.
This dissertation explores the problem of open-corpus personalization
and semantic modeling of open-corpus content in the context of
e-Learning. Information on WWW is not without structure. Many
collections of online instructional material (tutorials, electronic
books, digital libraries, etc.) have been provided with implicit
knowledge models encoded in form of tables of content, indexes, headers
of chapters, links between pages, and different styles of text
fragments. The main dissertation approach tries to leverage this layer
of hidden semantics by extracting and representing it as coarse-grained
models of collections. A central domain ontology is used to maintain
overlay modeling of studentsÕ knowledge and serves as a reference point
for multiple collections of external instructional material. In order to
establish the link between the ontology and the open-corpus content
models a special ontology mapping algorithm has been developed. The
proposed approach has been applied in the Ontology-based Open-corpus
Personalization Service (OOPS) that recommends and adaptively annotates
online reading material. The domain of Java programming has been chosen
for the proof-of-concept implementation. A controlled experiment has
been organized to evaluate the developed adaptive system and the
proposed approach overall. The results of the evaluation have
demonstrated several significant learning effects of the implemented
open-corpus personalization. The analysis of log-based data has also
shown that the open-corpus version of the system is capable of providing
personalization of similar quality to the close-corpus one. Such results
indicate that the proposed approach supports fully-scale open-corpus
personalization for e-Learning. Further research is required to verify
if the approach remains effective in other subject domains and with
other types of instructional content.\n\n====

Providing Service-Based Personalization In An Adaptive Hypermedia System

of new adaptive hypermedia systems. The gist of the approach is to
extract the adaptation functionality out of the adaptive hypermedia
system, encapsulate it into a standalone system, and offer adaptation as
a service to the client applications. Such a standalone adaptation
provider reduces the development of adaptation functionality to
configuration and compliance and as a result creates new adaptive
