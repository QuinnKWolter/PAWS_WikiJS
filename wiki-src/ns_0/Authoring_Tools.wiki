We have developed four major types of authoring tools for the project: 1) Content Authoring Tools for creating different kinds of smart learning content, 2) Course Authoring Tool for creating adaptive courses that use the content, 3) Group Authoring Tool for managing users and groups, as well as 4) the portal to access different authoring tools.\n\n== Content Authoring Tools ==\n{|\n|valign="top" | [[Image:ExampleAuthoringModify.jpg|thumb|left|'''100'''|Annotated Example Authoring]]\n|valign="top" | This set of tools provide the interface for teachers to create or modify problems or annotated examples, index problems or examples with concepts, arranged problems or examples under topics for Mastery Grids, etc. It supports multiple domains including Java and Python. Currently, for authoring semantics problems, we developed QuizJET, QuizPET Authoring Systems; for authoring parson problems, we developed Parson Problem Authoring System; for authoring annotated examples, we developed Example Authoring System; for authoring animated examples, we developed Animated Example Authoring System.\n\n* [[Content Authoring Tools|More about Content Authoring Tools]]\n* [[QuizJET Authoring System|More about QuizJET Authoring]] \n* [[QuizPET Authoring System|More about QuizPET Authoring]]\n* [[Parson Problem Authoring System|More about Parson Problem Authoring]]\n* [[Annotated Example Authoring System|More about Annotated Example Authoring]]\n* [[Animated Example Authoring System|More about Animated Example Authoring]]\n|}\n\n== Course Authoring Tool ==\n{|\n|valign="top" | [[Image:CourseAuthoringCourseList.jpg|thumb|left|'''100'''|Course Authoring]]\n|valign="top" | Course authoring tool provides the interface for teachers to create courses for Mastery Grids. It is an intuitive, highly integrated application for teaching material aggregation and editing. It allows the user to form the structure of a course, browse and select the activities from the resource pool and fill in the structure with appropriate examples and quizzes. The architecture supporting course authoring tool has a good support on multiple resource repositories, which is extremely convenient for future extending.
