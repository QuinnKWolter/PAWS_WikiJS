Mastery Grids supports and provides multiple types of learning materials. It has been applied in three domains (Java, SQL, and Python) as a supplementary E-learning system for undergraduate and graduate level programming and database classes since 2013. In each learning domain, courses are organized by topics and different types of learning contents are arranged under each topic. Learning contents contain semantics, problems, parson problems, annotated examples, and animated examples. This sections reviews all these content types.\n\nWhile Mastery Grids interface can support any kind of content, we try to focus on "smart learning content" that interactively engages student, collects interaction data, and provides various kinds of feedback. For a discussion and definition of smart learning content, see the following ITiCSE Working Group Report:\n\nBrusilovsky, P., Edwards, S., Kumar, A., Malmi, L., Benotti, L., Buck, D., Ihantola, P., Prince, R., Sirkiä, T., Sosnovsky, S., Urquiza, J., Vihavainen, A., and Wollowski, M. (2014) [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273380880_Increasing_Adoption_of_Smart_Learning_Content_for_Computer_Science_Education Increasing Adoption of Smart Learning Content for Computer Science Education]. In: Proceedings of the Working Group Reports of the 2014 on Innovation & Technology in Computer Science Education Conference, Uppsala, Sweden, ACM, pp. 31-57. \n\n\n== Code-Tracing Problems for Java and Python ==\nWe have developed a content application [[QuizJET]] providing problems to learn Java Programming. Here are two problems for Java. The left one shows a problem with a single class asking the value of a variable in a piece of code. The right one shows a problem with multiple classes asking the console output of a piece of code. Correctness is accessed by the content application and students can attempt multiple times with different instantiations of the variables in the problem.  Similarly, we have developed a content application [[QuizPET]] providing the same type of problems to learn Python Programming.\n\nNew problems for [[QuizJET]] and [[QuizPET]] could be easily created with [[QuizJET Authoring System]] tool and [[QuizPET Authoring System]].\n\n[[Image:Problems.jpg|650x1300px]]\n\n== SQL Problems ==\n\nFor learning SQL, we have developed a content application [[SQLKnoT]] providing another type of problem. Students are asked to write a complete query to achieve a task in each problem. Here is a problem for SQL. \n\n[[Image:Problems_Sql.jpg|500x750px]]\n\n== Parson Problems for Python ==\nHere is a parson problems for Python. In such problems, students are asked to drag different fragments of a code to construct a complete code in order to achieve a task. Some examples of created parson problems can be found [http://acos.cs.hut.fi/ here] under "Installed content packages" (e.g. jsparsons-python tab).\n\nNew parson problems can be created by [[Parson Problem Authoring System]].\n\n[[Image:ParsonProblems.jpg|750x1000px]]\n\n== Annotated Examples for Java, Python, and SQL ==\nWe have developed a content application [[WebEx]] providing annotated examples. Students can click on the left side box to learn about each line’s related concepts. We has a large collection of WebEx examples for Java, Python, SQL, C, and other programming languages. New WebEx examples could be created with [[Annotated Example Authoring System]]. \n\nSince 2016, we switched to a more advanced system [[PCEX]] for presenting annotated worked code examples for Python and Java. WebEx is still being used to present SQL code examples. [[PCEX]] has its own authoring system [[WEAT]].\n\nBelow,  you can see an annotated WebEx code examples for Python. It is presented using [[JSWebEx]] is a newer Javascript interface that replaces the old server-side WebEx interface, but using the same large collection of examples developed for WebEx. \n\n[[Image:jswebex.png|650x800px]]\n\n== Animated Examples for Python and Java ==\nWe have created a large number of animated program execution examples for Python, Java, and SQL. In such examples, the line-by-line execution of a piece of code is visualized by animations. \n\nHere is an animated example for Python. More animated examples created for Python can be found [http://acos.cs.hut.fi/ here] under "Installed content packages" (e.g. jsvee-python tab).\n\nNew animated example can be created by [[Animated Example Authoring System]].\n\n[[Image:AnimatedExamples.jpg|750x1000px]]\n\n== Animated Examples for SQL ==\n\nWe developed a collection of animated examples for SQL using Flash. More animated examples created for SQL can be found [http://columbus.exp.sis.pitt.edu/sql_ae_demo/ here]. Unfortunately, these examples can't be executed in modern browsers anymore.\n\n[[Image:AnimatedExamplesSQL.jpg|750x1000px]]\n\n== Videos ==\nWe have created applications for collecting, editing, authoring videos. The related codes can be found in [https://github.com/PAWSLabUniversityOfPittsburgh/educvideos Github].
