== Overview ==\nAnnotEx - Example Annotator- is a web-based community based authoring tool for annotating programming examples. There are three stages of a complete example annotating process. The first stage is to author the annotation of the example. The second stage is to peer review others' work by providing ratings/comments on the example annotations. The third stage is to re-annotate the example annotations. The annotated examples will not only be presented through AnnotEx itself, but also WebEx and  [[NavEx]].\n\n==Screenshots==\n[[Image:AnnotEx.gif|AnnotEx]]\n\n==Pubications==\n[[Publications]] related to AnnotEx\n\n==Contacts==\n[[User:shoha99 | Sharon, I-Han Hsiao]]
