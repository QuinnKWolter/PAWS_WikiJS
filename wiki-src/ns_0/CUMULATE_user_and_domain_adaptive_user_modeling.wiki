This stream of work is aimed at improving [[CUMULATE]]'s [[CUMULATE asymptotic knowledge assessment|legacy]] ''one-fits-all'' algorithm for  modeling user's problem-solving activity and creating a context-sensitive user modeling algorithm adaptable/adaptive to individual users' cognitive abilities as well as to individual problem complexities.\n\nA new [[CUMULATE parametrized asymptotic knowledge assessment|parametrized]] user modeling algorithm has been devised. A set of studies is set up to evaluate the new algorithm as well as its adaptability/adaptivity.\n\n==Study 1==\nThis study involves retrospective comparative evaluation of the [[CUMULATE]]'s [[CUMULATE asymptotic knowledge assessment|legacy]] and [[CUMULATE parametrized asymptotic knowledge assessment|parametrized]] user modeling algorithms. The evaluation is done using [[CUMULATE_Usage_Logs#Database_Management_6_Course_Dataset|usage logs]] collected from 6 Database Management courses offered during Fall 2007 and Spring 2008 semesters at the [http://www.pitt.edu University of Pittsburgh], [http://www.ncirl.ie National College of Ireland], and [http://www.dcu.ie Dublin City University]. Each course had roughly the same structure and an identical set of problems served by [[SQLKnoT]] system.\n\n=== Scenario ===\nWe were comparing [[CUMULATE asymptotic knowledge assessment|legacy]] CUMULATE algorithm and 3 versions of [[CUMULATE parametrized asymptotic knowledge assessment|parametrized]] algorithm. The versions differed in the parameters used for user modeling.\n* First, was an attempt to shadow the [[CUMULATE asymptotic knowledge assessment|legacy]] algorithm by ''guessing'' the best parameters for modeling, without discriminating individual user and problem differences.\n* The second version, did not discriminate users/problems as well. However, the parameters were obtained by fitting one global user parameter and one global problem parameter signature and then using them for the modeling.\n* The third version of the [[CUMULATE parametrized asymptotic knowledge assessment|parametrized]] algorithm worked with a set of user specific parameters and problem specific parameter signatures for the modeling.\n\n=== Procedures ===\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy Accuracy] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sum_of_squared_error SSE] (sum of squared error) were used as the metrics of comparison. They were computed overall for each of the 6 semester logs and 4 versions of algorithms.\n\nIn the case of [[CUMULATE asymptotic knowledge assessment|legacy CUMULATE]] and [[CUMULATE parametrized asymptotic knowledge assessment|parametrized CUMULATE]]-best-guess algorithms, the data was taken as it. The globally parametrized, and individually paramatrized CUMULATE algorithms were supplied with the pre-fit global/individual user/problem-specific parameters. The data of only one of the early courses was used to obtain the parameters. Data of all 6 was used to compute parametrized models.

Individual problem-specific parameters, however, do give it an advantage. In majority of the cases this advantage is significant (with exception to the only graduate level course offered at [http://www.pitt.edu Pitt] in Fall 2007 semester)\n{|\n|\n[[Image:CUMULATE legacy vs parameterized - sql 6 semester dataset - accuracy.png]]\n<br/>([http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=lxy&chs=300x240&chd=t:-1|61,32,63,65|-1|39,39,44,46|-1|40,40,45,54|-1|50,50,50,65|-1|66,66,66,75|-1|47,42,55,57&chco=24588E,4C9B46,F3A030,CF1E2B,78387B,7C807F&chxt=x,y&chxl=1:|.3|.4|.5|.6|.7|.8|0:|Cl|Cp:bg|Cp:al|Cp:ea/al&chxp=1,30,40,50,60,70,80|&chds=30,80&chxr=1,30,80,10&chm=o,24588E,0,-1,10|o,4C9B46,1,-1,10|o,F3A030,2,-1,10|o,CF1E2B,3,-1,10|o,78387B,4,-1,10|o,7C807F,5,-1,10&chg=-1,10&chdl=Pitt+08-1+U|Pitt+08-1+G|Pitt+08-2+U|NCI+08-2+U|NCI+08-2+U|DCU+08-2+U&chdlp=r&chtt=Algorithm+prediction+accuracy|for+different+semesters alternatively] via [http://code.google.com/apis/chart/ Google Chart API])\n|\n[[Image:CUMULATE legacy vs parameterized - sql 6 semester dataset - SSE.png]]\n<br/>([http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=lxy&chs=300x240&chd=t:-1|33,67,28,28|-1|57,61,46,46|-1|59,60,45,42|-1|50,50,36,30|-1|34,34,24,21|-1|46,58,33,35&chco=24588E,4C9B46,F3A030,CF1E2B,78387B,7C807F&chxt=x,y&chxl=1:|.2|.3|.4|.5|.6|.7|0:|Cl|Cp:bg|Cp:al|Cp:ea/al&chxp=1,20,30,40,50,60,70|&chds=20,70&chxr=1,20,70,10&chm=o,24588E,0,-1,10|o,4C9B46,1,-1,10|o,F3A030,2,-1,10|o,CF1E2B,3,-1,10|o,78387B,4,-1,10|o,7C807F,5,-1,10&chg=-1,10&chdl=Pitt+08-1+U|Pitt+08-1+G|Pitt+08-2+U|NCI+08-2+U|NCI+08-2+U|DCU+08-2+U&chdlp=r&chtt=Algorithm+SSE|for+different+semesters alternatively] via [http://code.google.com/apis/chart/ Google Chart API])\n\n|}\n\n=== Publication ===\nThe results were presented during the [http://www.i-fest.pitt.edu/ i-fest 2009] poster competition at the [http://www.ischool.pitt.edu/ School of Information Sciences], [http://www.pitt.edu/ University of Pittsburgh] and got the second place in the PhD track.
