The gist of the approach is to extract the adaptation functionality out of the\nadaptive hypermedia system, encapsulate it into a standalone system, and offer adaptation as a\nservice to the client applications. Such standalone adaptation provider reduces the development\nof adaptation functionality to configuration and compliance and as a result creates new adaptive\nsystems faster and helps serve larger user populations with adaptively accessible content.

By combining the personalized search and the interactive visualization, we expect our approach will be able to help users to better explore the information space and locate relevant information more efficiently.
