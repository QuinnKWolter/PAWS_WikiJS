Interactive Electronic Textbook for Python Programming and Data Science
Courses</a> ===\n\nPeter Brusilovsky proposes to develop AdaPT, an
interactive and adaptive system for learning and practicing Python
programming and Data Science skills, which fuses a well-tested
electronic textbook with a large volume of “smart” interactive learning
content: worked code examples, code animations, and several types of
automatically assessed practice problems. The system uses advanced
learner modeling to trace the growth of learner’s knowledge and skills
and to identify misunderstood concepts. Adapting dynamically to the
current state of knowledge, it suggests most appropriate interactive
content to practice at every step of learning. \n\nSupported by

and Evaluating Exploratory Recommender Systems</a>===\nExploratory
recommender systems bring together the power of Human and Artificial
Intelligence through human-AI collaboration and user-controlled
recommendation. In this project, we develop and evaluate exploratory
recommender systems in several domains. The focus of the project are
carousel-based interfaces and novel recommender algorithms that can
better adapt to user actions in the human-AI collaboration
process.\n\nSupported by Amazon Research Award to Peter Brusilovsky

Infrastructure for Sustainable Innovation and Research in Computer
Science Education</a>===\nResearchers from the University of Pittsburgh,
Carnegie Mellon University, North Carolina State University, and
Virginia Tech collaborate to support the Computer Science Education Hub,
social and technical infrastructure to accelerate research on teaching
and learning of computing disciplines. The Hub will host community
events and provide a web repository for computing education datasets,
tools, and common analysis methods. The Hub facilitates creation and
adoption of new tools to support computing educators and students, and
new standards to support data collection and data-enabled research. Hub
community events help researchers and educators from many learning
contexts to develop and improve computing education
resources.\n\nSupported by NSF grant [CNS 2213789

Complementary Learning Principles in Aphasia Rehabilitation via Adaptive
Modeling</a>===\n\nAphasia, commonly caused by stroke or other acquired
brain injuries, can have a negative effect on an individual’s quality of
life, often leading to depression and feelings of isolation. A primary
frustration for people with aphasia is anomia, or word-finding
difficulty. In this NIH-funded project, an interdisciplinary team of
researchers will work on developing and evaluating novel adaptive
computer-based aphasia treatments to help improve the efficiency and
long-term impact of language treatment.\n\nSupported by NIH grant

- Health e-Librarian with Personalized Recommender</a>===\nAs the
Internet has become a prominent source of health information to guide
patients’ decision-making and self-management activities, patients
strongly indicate they need navigational support to locate appropriate
information on the Internet. The overall goal of this project is to
build and implement a “Health E-Librarian with Personalized
Recommendations (HELPeR)” - a personalized information access system
with a hybrid recommender engine that adapts to different aspects of the
patient: information needs based on the user’s profile, the user’s
uniquely expressed information interests, and the level of user’s
disease-related knowledge. \n\nSupported by NIH grant

Science Education</a>===\nThe mission of this collaborative project is
to support the CS Education community by supplying documentation and
infrastructure to help with adopting shared standards, protocols, and
tools. In this way we hope to promote\n\* development and broader re-use
of innovative learning content that is instrumented for rich data
collection;\n\* formats and tools for analysis of learner data; and\n\*
best practices to make large collections of learner data and associated
analytics available to researchers in the CSE, data science, and learner
science communities.\nFor a more complete description of our vision and

project is a joint effort of research teams at the University of Memphis
and the University of Pittsburgh to explore the process of code
comprehension by students and build AI-based tools to support the

code-tracing tools to practice code comprehension, and an intelligent
tutor for assessing code comprehension through
