## Overview

\nAnnotEx - Example Annotator- is a web-based community based authoring
tool for annotating programming examples. There are three stages of a
complete example annotating process. The first stage is to author the
annotation of the example. The second stage is to peer review others'
work by providing ratings/comments on the example annotations. The third
stage is to re-annotate the example annotations. The annotated examples
will not only be presented through AnnotEx itself, but also WebEx and
