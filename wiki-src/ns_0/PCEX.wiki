Program Construction Examples (PCEX) is an interactive learning tool which demonstrates program construction examples to help students to develop program construction skills. It supports exploring the program construction examples freely and provide challenges to the students to help them self-assess their learning of program construction knowledge. Each ''example'' provides a goal that specify the given example’s functionality. Each ''challenge'' is designed closely to the examples provided with faded lines. Students need to drag-drop provided sample lines to complete a program to accomplish the provided program goal. \n\n== PCEX Interface ==\n===Example===\nThe first screenshot is from an example in PCEX about celsius to fahrenheit conversion with interactive explanation of the selected line (highlighted in yellow) \n\n[[Image:Pcex_ex.PNG|600px]]\n\n===Challenge===\nThe second screenshot is from an challenge in PCEX which is the ‘challenge’ of the previously shown example. Here the goal of the program is to complete the program which converts fahrenheit to celsius. In the current screenshot, the student made a mistake in one of the missing lines and got immediate feedback stating that the output of the current program is different from the expected one. Student may see the details of the error or request for a hint which basically describes the explanation of that missing line. \n \n[[Image:Pcex_ch.PNG|600px]]\n\n== Available Domains ==\nPCEX smart content is available to be used with Java and Python programming languages.\n\n== Demos ==\n* A [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv46knva1Lo demo of PCEX for Python], as a part of PCLab, a [[MasteryGrids]] setup to practice construction knowledge for Python\n* A [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGTkrTJ7YaM demo of PCEX for Java], as a part of PCLab, a [[MasteryGrids]] setup to practice construction knowledge for Java\n\n== Publications ==\nHosseini, R., Akhuseyinoglu, K., Petersen, A., Schunn, C.
