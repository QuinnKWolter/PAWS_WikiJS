support from National Science Foundation and School of Information
Sciences. The goal of the PAWS Lab is development and evaluation of
innovative user- and group-adaptive Web-based technologies, systems, and
architectures. The Lab currently explores a range of user modeling,
adaptation and personalization technologies. The work of the Lab is
