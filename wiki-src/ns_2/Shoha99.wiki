==Sharon (I-Han) Hsiao==\nPAWS Alumna, PhD (2012), Assistant Professor and David Packard endowed junior fellow, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Santa Clara University\n[[Image:Hsiao.jpg|left]]\n\n\nDr. Sharon Hsiao is Assistant Professor & David Packard endowed junior fellow in the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at Santa Clara University. Dr. Hsiao was an assistant professor at Arizona State University and Columbia University, where she established several research projects and taught graduate & undergraduate level courses. Dr. Hsiao’s research focuses on educational technologies, computational modeling, visual analytics, and adaptive technology for personalized learning. Her research methodology involves AI and HCI approaches, applied data science and machine learning techniques in researching effective technology to help people learn. Dr. Hsiao actively involves in several international research communities, including Educational Data Mining (EDM), Learning Analytics & Knowledge(LAK), Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED), and European Conference on Technology Enhanced Learning (EC-TEL). She serves as the Program Chair of 14th International Conference on Educational Data Mining and the Organizing Chair of the 9th of International Conference on Learning Analytics & Knowledge.\n\nPrior to SCU, Sharon has worked in EdLab in Teachers College at Columbia University as a post-doctoral innovation fellow. She was also affiliated with Columbia's Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences (QMSS) program as an adjunct Assistant Professor, where she taught a course on Data Visualization and supervised several graduate research projects. Sharon has also served as an Assistant Professor in the School of Computing, Informatics & Decision Systems Engineering at Arizona State University. \n\nSharon's interests in computational technologies for learning, open social student modeling and computer science education originate from her formative years at the iSchool at Pitt, where she worked with Dr. Peter Brusilovsky in the Personalized Adaptive Web Systems (PAWS) group. Under Dr. Brusilovsky’s guidance, Hsiao had “an amazing experience” working in the PAWS lab and most enjoyed working “collaboratively and independently” with other students to “produce high quality publications yearly, exchange ideas, share passions and support each other every day.”\n\n== Projects ==\n* [[Ensemble]]\n== Systems ==\n* [[AnnotEx]]\n* [[QuizJET]]\n* [[QuizPET]]\n* [[Progressor]]\n* [[ProgressorPlus]]\n\n==Research Interests==\n* Peer Review\n* CSCL\n* Social Web\n* [[Open Social Student Modeling]]\n* ITS\n* Social Visualization
