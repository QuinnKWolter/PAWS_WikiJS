projects at the Department of Cognitive Science and Education and IBM
Watson Life Group such as Project Cardinal, Sesame Workshop, and [Chef
Watson](https://www.ibmchefwatson.com). He is specialized in information
visualization, human-computer interaction, personalized search, and
recommender systems. Before joining IBM, he was a member of the School
of Information Sciences PAWS (Personalized Adaptive Web Systems) Lab and
received his Ph.D. while publishing a number of papers with his advisor
Professor Peter Brusilovsky at premier conferences and journals such as
World Wide Web 2007/2008, UMAP (User Modeling, Adaptation, and
Personalization) 2010, Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI) 2015, Web
Intelligence (WI) and IP&M (Information Processing and
Management).\n\nAfter graduation, he was selected as a prestigious
NSF-CRA Computing Innovation Fellow (http://cifellows.org) in 2010 and
worked with Professor Ben Shneiderman at the University of Maryland
Human-Computer Interaction Lab. The fellowship supported outstanding new
computer or information science Ph.D.'s on their post-doctoral research.
His work on network evolution visualization was published at conferences
and a journal. In particular his IEEE TVCG (Transactions on
Visualization and Computer Graphics) article was selected as the
Highlight of the Month by the journal editors and was invited to present
